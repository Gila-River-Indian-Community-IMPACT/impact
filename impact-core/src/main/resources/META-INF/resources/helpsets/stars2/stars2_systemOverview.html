<h1>System Overview </h1>

<p>This system provides straight forward web-based access to the
functionality you require to support your work for the Ohio EPA's
Division of Air Pollution Control. It supports the full range of
permitting activity, maintenance of <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility information</font>, <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Emissions
report</font> processing, including <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">invoicing</font>, and <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Compliance report</font>
processing. A subset of these capabilities is available to Regulated
Community Users (RCUs) via the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">IMPACT</font> System that RCU's may access via
the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Ohio EPA eBusiness Gateway</font>. There, RCUs may see AQD's view of
their facility's<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"> history</font> (permitting, reporting, etc.), make changes to
their <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility Detail</font>, and enter permitting requests and reports via
web-based forms similar to those available on this system to AQD
personnel.</p>

<p>The system brings all the information about each facility 
together and makes it available from a single location so that you can 
access whatever information you need when you need it. The system also 
provides reports and tools that give managers and adminstrators 
additional information they can use to effectively support you in your 
work.</p>
<p>In addition to an overview of the system's organization, this help topic also
gives you a brief summary of the functionality you will find under each tab, as well as links
to help topics that provide more detail on that functionality and how you can use it
effectively.</p>


<h2>System Organization</h2>

<p>The system is organized around the basic services that you provide to
each other, to the Agency, the State, and to your clients, the
regulated facilities throughout the state:</p>

<ul>

  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Manage your tasks</font>
  </li>
  <li>Manage the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">workflow</font> for AQD services such as permit and report
processing
  </li>
  <li>Organize and access current and historical data about the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facilities
    </font>with which you interact
  </li>
  <li>Process permit <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">applications</font> (and permitting action requests)
  </li>
  <li>Develop air <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">permits</font>
  </li>
  <li>Process submitted <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">emissions inventories</font>
  </li>
  <li>Process submitted <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">compliance reports</font>
  </li>
  <li>Manage permitting and emissions fee <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">invoicing</font>
  </li>
  <li>Provide helpful <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">management reports</font>, along with an infrastructure to
create new reports as needed
  </li>
  <li>Provide <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">tools</font> to support various functionality, including document
generation, correspondence management, facility-based event tracking,
facility role management,
  </li>
  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Administer</font> aspects of the system to
accommodate changing information and changing needs</li>
</ul>

<p>You will only be able to see and access the information and
capabilities that are associated with the 'role' you are assigned in
the system. Therefore, you may not be able to see or use some of the
functionality described below.</p>
<p>The remainder of this page gives you an overview of the capability you 
can access from the tabs, each of which represents one of the organizational 
areas listed above.  In addition, you will find links to <a href="#rel_topics">Related 
Help Topics</a> at the bottom of the page.<br> </p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>

<h2>Home Tab</h2>

<p>The <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Home </font>tab keeps track of all the active work items in the system. By
default, it shows all the '<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">In Process</font>' tasks assigned to you; it is
your <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">To Do</font> list. The list gives you the mechanism to manage your
workload. It has information about each task, including how long tasks
have been <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">In Process</font> and their status, for example, '<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Jeopardy</font>' or
'<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Late</font>'. It also has links to information about the facility associated
with the task, how the individual task fits and where it falls within
the workflow of which it is a step. Linked task screens provide you
support with respect to completing the task.</p>

<p>You may also explicitly
add work items to your <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">To Do</font> list --- an effective mechanism to keep
track of all you have to do. Managers may also use the list to track
the workload of their staff members, as well as the status of work
related to specific facilities.</p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>

<h2>Workflow Tab</h2>

<p>The <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Workflow</font> 
tab allows you to locate <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">
In Process workflows</font> in the system.&nbsp; 
A workflow tracks the various activities and tasks that take place in
order to accomplish a particular processing operation.  For example, taking
a permit application and following it through all the steps until it has been
"Issued Final".  The Workflow Diagram offers you a pictorial representation 
of the step and allows you to see, at a glance, where the its life cycle.
If you have appropriate authority, you can manipulate, from this tab,
 the tasks in the
workflow --- Re-assign them to a different staff member, Refer them to
an outside agency, or back to the applicant, etc.  For tasks assigned to
you, you can notify the system that you have completed the task, so that it
moves the workflow to its next task.</p>
<p>Also under this tab, you can see charts depicting summary information you
might find interesting, such as Open Workflows Processes by Status (OK, Jeopardy,
Late) or by Type (Permitting, Emissions Reporting, etc.)  The summary charts
give you capability to "drill down" to the level of the individual workflows
for any status or type you choose.</p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>

<h2>Facilities Tab</h2>

<p>The <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facilities tab</font> lets you locate individual facilities in the system
using various combinations of search criteria such as <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">supporting
DO/LAA, County, Facility Class, Permit Status, etc.</font> Upon
selecting an individual facility, this tab provides an overview of the
facility by displaying the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility Detail</font>. The <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Profile</font> is the heart
of the Stars2 system, because it displays or offers direct links to all
the current and historical information about that facility, from how
its control equipment is connected to any undelivered mail the division
has had for the facility. In addition to information access, if you are
authorized to do so, you can manipulate facility information such as
<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Operational Status, Facility Class, Emissions Reporting
Category, etc</font>. Nodes in the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">facility tree</font> give you direct links to
detail data about each <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">emissions unit, emissions process, instance of
control equipment</font> and <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">release point</font> that make up a facility's <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Emissions Profile</font>.</p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>

<h2>Applications Tab</h2>

<p>The <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Applications tab</font> allows you to locate any electronic version of an
application for a specific facility by applying search criteria. Upon
selecting the specific search criteria, a datagrid will be displayed
with all applications that meet the criteria. Each of these
applications can be viewed by clicking on the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Application &#8220;Request
Number&#8221;</font> on the far left of the datagrid.</p>

<p><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Applications</font> that have not
been submitted to the system can be manipulated/edited in preparation
of final submission. <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Applications</font> that have been previously submitted
are not editable but information contained in the application can be
copied into new application or used again for subsequent application
preparation. Duplicative entry of data is therefore reduced to a
minimum.</p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>

<h2>Permits Tab</h2>

<p>The <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permits tab</font> houses all of the electronic versions of permits ever
<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">issued, denied, pending, </font>or in <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">any stage of issuance</font>. Using search
criteria, you can find permits and pending permit actions specifically
for each facility in the database. Permits that were issued prior to
the June 30th, 2008 date are available in either HTML or WordPerfect
formats. These permits are attached to each permitting action in either
the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">attachments</font> section or in the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">terms and conditions </font>sections of the
<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">permit detail</font> page.</p>

<p><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit actions</font> that have not been completed can be
searched for and manipulated. <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit actions</font> that have been finalized
and issued are available for download, but the final versions of the
permits are not editable.</p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>

<h2>Emissions Inventories Tab</h2>

<p>The <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Emissions Inventories tab</font> allows you to search for general and specific
emissions inventories that are either <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">in progress, need reviewed, </font>or have
been<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"> approved and subsequently invoiced</font>. The reports that have not been
submitted will be viewable and editable, but those reports that have
been submitted and subsequently approved will only be available for
versioning/copying and editing as needed.</p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>

<h2>Compliance Reports Tab</h2>

<p>The <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Compliance Reports tab</font> allows you to search for <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">compliance reports</font>
associated with specific facilities or those related to a specific
DO/LAA or the entire State of Ohio. Each search criteria field can be
filled in to limit the search to as narrow or broad a spectrum you
wish. The reports that are currently required to be submitted
electronically from TV and SMTV facilities will be searchable through
this tab. These include <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">TVCC</font> and <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">PERs</font> for <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">FEPTIOs</font>. Other compliance
reports may or may not be available through the compliance report tab
depending on DO/LAA and external client participation. Each compliance
report that is added to a specific facility to the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Compliance Report(s)
third level menu</font> will be available in the future.</p>

<p>It is important to
note that no tracking mechanism has been established to track
compliance with report submission through this program.</p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>

<h2>Invoices Tab</h2>
For a limited number of users, the Invoices tab provides the capability to post
invoices to Revenues and to Print Invoices in bulk operations.  In addition,
it allows you to search for invoices according to several important criteria,
such as  and to view individual invoice details.  Although anyone with 
access to this
tab can see most invoice details, in order to see details reflecting
activities in Revenues, such as whether the invoice has been paid,
and the current balance on the invoice, the system must 
be able to
communicate with the Revenue system on your behalf.

<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>

<h2>Management Reports Tab</h2>
This tab provides management with several reports that they can use to
manage their work, and yours.  In addition, authorized users may insert reports 
of a specific type into the system.  You may develop such reports 
outside the system with a very flexible third-party tool.  After reports
have been added to the Report Catalog, the reports can be run, on demand
from this tab.

<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>

<h2>Tools Tab</h2>
The Tools Tab gives you the capability to perform certain general functions
and bulk operations
without having to involve a system administrator.  For example, in this tab
you can search the log of events that the system records, such as changes
in the value of selected data items and you can filter your search to acccess
only events that apply to a particular facility or group of facilities, 
or those related to permitting activity or events that were recorded 
during a time period you can specify. Some internal logs and other 
operations may be available to selected users.
<p>You can do similar searches on the Correspondence and Correspondence 
history that the system maintains, including tracking certified mail.  This
tab also provides you with direct links to lots of websites that can easily
provide you with important reference data and other guidance, 
as well as access to some temporary files, such as documents you generate
that aren't stored in the system, for a short period of time before they
are purged.
 

<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>

<h2>Admin Tab</h2>
The Admin Tab provides an interface to the system for a very small group
of users who have been assigned adminstrative access to the system.  Most users 
will never see this tab.  Administrators can access and modify reference data,
adjust the system roles assigned to user (which control to some
extent what each user can
see and do in the system) and perform other rarely-required 
administrative functions.  There are no Help Topics available for this
administrative functionality.  Instead, these capabilities are documented
in the Stars2 System Administrator's Guide.

<h1>Exception Reporting<br></h1>
<h2>Overview </h2>
<p>This topic covers the various ways that the system validates the information
you enter, and how it lets you know if there is an error or exception in
the data. It covers the following kinds of validation, and their associated
exception reporting:

<ul>
<li><a href="#editSave" target="">Edit/Save Exception</a></li>
<li><a href="#simple" target="">Simple Field Validation</a></li>
<li><a href="#required" target="">Required Fields <br></a></li>
<li><a href="#dependent" target="">Field Dependencies <br></a></li>
<li><a href="#complex" target="">Complex Form Validation <br></a></li>
</ul>
<p>
In the case of simple messages produced by the IMPACT System, the system writes 
the message in red at the 
upper right of the 
screen, directly above the page title.  In more complex cases, the errors
are displayed in a pop-up window.  In both cases, the system shows you (or
takes you to) the place on the screen where the error occurred so that you
can easily fix it.
<!-- ********** Edit/Save Exception************ -->
<h2><a name="editSave"></a><br>Edit/Save Exception</h2>
You must <img src="images/btn_save.jpg" alt="Save button"> or 
<img src="images/btn_capCancel.jpg" alt="Cancel button"> your editing session whenever 
you want to navigate away from a page where you can edit any information EVEN IF YOU DID NOT
ENTER OR CHANGE ANYTHING.  If you try to move away from the screen without doing so, you 
will see the following message:
</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="images/saveDiscardPopup.jpg" alt="Save-Discard Popup">
<br><br>
<b>Browser Exception Window</b><br>
</div>


</div>
<p>When this window pops up, you must click <img src="images/btn_ok.jpg" alt="Save/OK Button">
in the popup window and THEN click <img src="images/btn_save.jpg" alt="Save button"> or 
<img src="images/btn_capCancel.jpg" alt="Cancel button"> in the edit window you
have open, depending on whether you wish to preserve any changes you may have made or not.  Note that
the wording in the popup says "Save or discard", but the button labels on your edit window
are almost always "Save" and "Cancel".
<p>When this exception occurs, you will NOT see an error message at the top of the page; the
popup is the only notification you receive.
</p>
<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>

<p><!-- ********** Simple Field Validation Exceptions************ -->
<h2><a name="simple"></a><br>Simple Field Validation <br></h2>
<p>
In many, but not all cases, the system checks to see that any data you enter, 
for example in a text input field, is the right kind of data for that field
and is in the right format.  For example, if a field expects numeric data
and you give it a character string made up of letters, you will get an
exception such as this:
<div align="center">
<img src="images/except_fieldError.jpg" alt="Exception: Invalid Numeric Input">
<br><br>
<b>Invalid Numeric Input Exception</b><br>
</div>
 
<p>The system performs this check whenever you <img src="images/btn_save.jpg" alt="Save button">
or otherwise navigate away from an edit page.
</p>
<p> 
The exception message is displayed as described in the <a href="#start">Overview</a> 
section, and indicates, with an icon (<img src="images/icon_fieldException.jpg" alt="Field Exception Icon">)and a description of the error 
on the screen near the field for which the input was invalid. 
</p>
<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>

<!-- ********** Required Field Exceptions************ -->
<h2><a name="required"></a><br>Required Fields<br></h2>
<p>
Required field validation is similar to Simple Field Validation in that the system
performs this validation whenever you Save changes you have made in on an edit
screen.  The system checks to be sure that you have completed every field which is
marked with an asterisk (<img src="images/icon_asterisk.jpg" alt="Asterisk Icon">) as
shown below on AQD Emissions Unit ID field when you are entering a Compliance Report.
<div align="center">
<img src="images/requiredField.jpg" alt="Required Input Field"><br>
</div>
<p>If you fail to complete the required fields, like this one, 
on an edit page, the system displays an error similar to that illustrated above indicating
that a required field has not been completed. 
</p> 
<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>

<!-- ********** Field Dependency Exceptions -->
<h2><a name="dependent"></a><br>Field Dependencies<br></h2>
<p> 
In a few instances, there may be multiple fields on the same edit screen that are
dependent on each other.  For example: The window below shows some of the input
fields you may use if you are creating a new or revised Emissions Inventory.</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="images/erpt_editProcessInfo.jpg" alt="Required Input Field"><br><br>
<b>Process &amp; Emissions Detail Edit Window for Title V and SMTV Emissions Inventories</b><br>
</div>
<p>
If you click <img src="images/btn_save.jpg" alt="Save button"> on this window, you will see the
following error:
 <div align="center">
<img src="images/erpt_editProcessInfoError.jpg" alt="Required Input Field"><br><br>
<br>
</div>
<p>
Clearly, the check the system performs here depends on multiple input fields 
where the valid input depends on the sum of multiple fields, and all the fields are on
the same screen, so the system can validate the data when you Save it.
</p> 
<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>

<!-- ********** Complex Form Validation Exceptions ************ -->
<h2><a name="complex"></a><br>Complex Form Validation <br></h2>
<p>   
Some complex operations, such as entering permit application or facility change information, 
involve more than one screen where you must enter information.  In addition, some information 
is only required at certain stages of the operation.  You instruct the system to 
perform its complex validation for such operations when you click on the  
<img src="images/btn_validate.jpg" alt="Validate button"> button.  
The system uses complex validation rules and business logic to determine 
whether the information you have entered is internally consistent. For instance,
if you are building the emissions profile for your facility  (emissions units,
emissinos processes, control equipment and release points) and you choose to
Validate the data at the facility level and your data is not totally complete (at
least what you're required to specify) or is inconsistent, they the system 
presents a popup window that shows you a datagrid listing all the errors.  (If there
are a lot of errors, the datagrid may have several 'pages'.)  The figure below
is an example of a complex form validation error window 
that shows multiple errors.</p>
<p>
<div align="center">
<img src="images/complexValidationFailure.jpg" alt="Form Validation Error Popup Window">
<br><br>
<b>Complex Form Validation Failure Notification</b>
<br>
</div>
<p>
The validation operation gives you an error message at the top of the screen,
similar to those for the simpler
cases described above.
The popup window shows you all the validation errors it encountered.  It also tells you
about conditions it identified that are not errors, and will not cause subsequent
operations to fail, but which may represent incomplete data that you may want to 
correct.</p>
<p>If you click on any of the individual messages in the popup 
window, the system will take you to the screen where you can fix the error.  For 
example, if you click on <u>Attribute Filter/Baghouse is not set</u>, the system 
will take you to the Control Equipment Information page for the specific control equipment 
instance that is missing it's Filter/Baghouse attribute as shown in the figure below. There, you can 
Edit the page to enter whatever data is missing or otherwise correct the 
error.&nbsp; As you correct the errors, you can re-validate until you have 
corrected all of them.  Then the validation will succeed.</p>  
<p>
You can <img src="images/btn_validate.jpg" alt="Validate button"> your input at any time to
check your progress.  The system, however, will always validate it if you click 
<img src="images/btn_submit.jpg" alt="Submit button"> the Facility Detail Change (in this case)
or other object such as a Permit Application, Emissions or Compliance Report.</p>

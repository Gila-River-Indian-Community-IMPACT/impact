<h1>Permit Detail</h1>


<h2>Overview</h2>


<p>The <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit
Detail</font> page gives you several options for viewing details
of
a permit that has been issued or is in the process of being issued, and
for those in process, the ability to edit data that will be relevant to
issued documents. When Ohio EPA receives, or enters, an application
electronically, a corresponding <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit Detail</font>
page is generated. Only
those emissions units that are included in the application (not always
all emissions units at the facility) will be identified in the
corresponding <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit
Detail</font> page. The following types of permits are
available for viewing and, when applicable, editing: <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">PTI</font> (for
a
facility subject to the Title V program), <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">PTIO</font>
(for a facility subject
to the non-Title V program), <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Registration</font>
(historical), <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">State
PTO</font>
(historical), and <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">TV
PTO</font>. All <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit
Detail</font> pages contain the following
sections: a Facility Tree, <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit Information</font>
(<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Registration
Status</font> for
historical <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Registrations</font>),
<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Terms and
Conditions</font>, and <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Notes</font>.
The
contents of the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit
Detail</font> page will differ depending on the type of
permit you are working with (e.g., Title V versus PTIO).</p>


<p>At the top of the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit Detail</font>
page you will see and review basic facility
information and information on the permit&#8217;s status. Information
included in the heading is the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit Type</font>,
associated <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit
Number</font>
and issuance dates of the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Draft, PPP, PP,</font>
and <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Final</font>
permit documents,
where <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">N/A</font>
represents it is not applicable to the permit action. Also
included are the dates of any applicable <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Public Notice,
Hearing Notice,</font>
the actual <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Hearing</font>
and the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Comment
Period End</font>.</p>


<p>Some <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit
Detail</font> stages can be edited but others will be &#8220;locked&#8221; to
prevent access to data changes. If a permit has not been issued as
final and has not been dead-ended or denied, the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit Detail</font>
page
will be editable by clicking on the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Edit</font>
button at the bottom of the
page.</p>


<p>Please note, although permit-by-rule (<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">PBR</font>) is
a possible search
criteria from the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit
Search</font> page, <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">PBR</font>
details are not discussed in
this Help page. Whenever selecting a <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">PBR</font> from
a search, a <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit
Detail</font>
page will not be generated. You will go directly to the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Application
Detail</font> page whether the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">PBR</font> is
in process or has been reviewed. For
information on details regarding a <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">PBR</font>,
please refer to the Help page
for <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Application
Detail</font>.</p>


<p>Also, historical <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Registration</font>
and <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">State
PTO
Permit Detail</font> pages will not be discussed since editing of
these
actions cannot occur. If you are viewing one of these actions and would
like more information on the meaning of the fields you will see, refer

<h2>Permit Search</h2>


<p>In order to access a <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit Detail</font>
page, you can search for available
permits via the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit
Search </font>page. This is the default feature of the
<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permits</font>
tab. For information on searching permits, please refer to the
<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permits Search</font>
Help page.</p>


<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
<a name="duplicate"></a></p>


<h3>Duplicating Permits</h3>


<p>The moment an application for a PTI or PTIO is submitted a
workflow and
<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit Detail</font>
page will be generated allowing DO/LAA staff to begin the
permit process. Although applications may be submitted for multiple
types of actions (initial install, modification, etc.) there are
limitations in the type of actions that can be processed and issued in
one PTI or PTIO permit document (this is not applicable to Title V
permits). It may be necessary for Ohio EPA staff to split up the
emissions units included in one application into multiple permits for
issuance. As a general rule, each permitting action should have the
same processing path and end result. The following actions will need to
be separated into different permitting actions for processing:</p>


<ul>


  <li>Initial </li>


  <li>Chapter 31 modifications (Ch. 31 mod) </li>


  <li>Administrative modifications (admin mod) </li>


  <li>Renewals </li>


  <li>General permits </li>


</ul>


<p>For example, general permits do not go through Central Office
review.
Therefore, it could not be combined with an installation permit that
does require Central Office review. A separate <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit Detail</font>
page will
need to be generated for each permit type emissions unit combination.</p>


<p>If it is determined that an application should be processed in
more
than one separate permit documents, then you will need to split the
application into multiple <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit Detail</font>
pages resulting in multiple
issued permits. This is accomplished on the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Application Detail</font>
page by
selecting the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Duplicate
Permit/Workflow</font> button for each additional
<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit Detail</font>
page needed. For assistance in completing this step
please see the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Application
Detail</font> Help page.</p>


<p>Once the multiple permit
documents have been generated, open the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit Detail</font>
pages for the
duplicated permits. You will see that they also contain all of the
emissions units, in associated (Title V permits) or disassociated (PTI
and PTIO permits) form, that were included in the original application.
You will need to include/exclude, or associate/disassociate, the
emissions
units, as described under the heading &#8220;Including and Excluding
Emissions Units&#8221; below, so that each <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit Detail</font>
page contains the
appropriate emissions units that will be issued in each of the final
permit documents.</p>


<p><b><font color="red">VERY IMPORTANT - when
an application is submitted with
multiple permit reasons (actions), the corresponding </font><font color="red" face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit
Detail</font><font color="red"> page
will default the reason for the permit to the most stringent processing
reason for all emissions units identified in the application. As you
associate and disassociate emissions units in each of the </font><font color="red" face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit
Detail</font><font color="red">
pages you will need to review the application and correctly identify
the corresponding reason for the emissions unit(s) included in each
individual </font><font color="red" face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit Detail</font><font color="red"> page. This is accomplished under the
</font><font color="red" face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Reasons(s)</font><font color="red"> check box at the top level of the </font><font color="red" face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit
Detail</font><font color="red"> page as
discussed under the heading &#8220;PTI and PTIO Permit Information&#8221; below. It
is very important the appropriate reason is correctly identified for
each permit that will be issued from one application submittal.</font></b></p>


<p>Note: separating permit actions could result in different
issuance and
effective dates for emissions unit(s) which may be a part of the same
project. DO/LAA staff will need to work with Central Office to identify
if some actions should be issued together.</p>


<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
<a name="fac_tree"></a></p>


<h2>Facility Tree</h2>


<p>You will notice the Facility Tree on the left hand side of all
<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit
Detail</font> pages. Clicking any emissions unit ID in the
Facility Tree will
take you to an <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Emissions
Unit</font> page that allows you to edit, when
applicable, or simply view emissions unit information. Recall, you can
only edit information if the permit has not yet been issued. The
information you see, and that will be editable, will also depend on
whether the emissions units are associated (included) or disassociated
(excluded) with the specific <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit Detail</font>
page.</p>


<ul>


  <li><b>Gray Gears with X -&nbsp;</b><img alt="Gray Gears witn an X" src="images/Excluded_EU.gif" height="26" width="28"> &#8211; These emissions units
are
not part of, or they are
&#8220;disassociated&#8221; with this permit. </li>


  <li><font color="#3366ff"><b>Blue Gears</b></font>
-&nbsp;<img alt="Blue Gears" src="images/EU.gif" height="24" width="28"> &#8211; These emissions units
are
part of, or &#8220;associated&#8221;
with, the permit being viewed. </li>


</ul>


<p>When Ohio EPA receives, or enters, an application
electronically, a
corresponding <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit
Detail</font> page is generated. Only those emissions
units that are included in the application (not always all emissions
units at the facility) will be identified in the corresponding <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit
Detail</font> page as associated (Title V permits) or
disassociated (PTI and PTIO permits) with the permit. You will review
the application and determine if all requested emissions units should
be associated with the permit and make the appropriate
associations/disassociations. You may not associate emissions units
with the permit that were not included in the original application
submittal. This would required an amended/corrected application
submittal. You may not need to&nbsp;associate all emissions
units. This is necessary because there may be cases where not all
emissions units will be issued in the same permit document as discussed
above under the heading &#8220;Duplicating Permits.&#8221;
</p>

<a name="include_eu"></a></p>


<h3>Including or
Excluding Emissions Units</h3>


<p>You may exclude (disassociate) an emissions unit for a permit
not yet
issued which will allow you to remove emissions units that will
comprise the final permit. You may also include (associate) an
emissions unit only if it was originally included in the application
and then disassociated for some reason. Recall, when an application is
submitted in the system it will include, and the corresponding <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit
Detail</font> generated from the application, all emissions units
included in
the application submittal. It may be necessary to include or exclude
emissions units for various reasons. For example, several emissions
units may have been part of a planned project but the facility later
decided to not include one of the emissions units. Perhaps in the
middle of the permit process the facility decided to permanently
shutdown one of the emissions units included in a renewal application.
Very importantly, it may be necessary for Ohio EPA staff to split up
the emissions units included in one application into multiple permits
for issuance (see the &#8220;Duplicating Permits&#8221; heading above for details).
To include or exclude emissions units do one of the following:</p>


<ul>


  <li>Click on the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Add/Remove EUs</font>
button at the bottom of the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit Detail</font>
page. This button will take you to another page titled <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit Detail,
Emissions Units</font>. To add, select the emissions unit from
the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Available
EUs</font> and select <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Move</font> to
add it to the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Current
EUs</font>. To remove, select the
emissions unit from the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Current
EUs</font> and select <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Remove</font>
to move it to the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Available
EUs</font>. Don&#8217;t forget to select <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Save</font>. To
get back to the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit
Detail</font> page click on the permit number hyperlink on the
Facility Tree. </li>


  <li>Select the emissions unit on the Facility Tree and click
the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Add EU
to permit</font> button or <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Exclude EU from</font>
permit button. To get
back to the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit
Detail</font> page click on the permit number hyperlink on the
Facility
Tree.</li>


</ul>


<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
<a name="eu_info"></a></p>


<h3>Emissions Unit Information</h3>


<p>The following discusses the information you find on the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Emissions Unit</font>
page and the fields that are editable when you are working with a
permit that has not been issued. When an emissions unit is
disassociated with the permit object,&nbsp;<img alt="Gears with an X" src="images/Excluded_EU.gif" height="26" width="28"> , only the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">EU ID</font>
and <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">EU
Description</font> will be visible. <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Emissions Unit</font>
pages for those units
associated with the permit will contain the following information and
will be editable, when applicable, via an <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Edit</font>
button available at the
bottom of the page. Click <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Edit</font> to
make changes to the emissions unit
information.</p>


<ul>


  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">EU
ID</font>- The unique ID that is assigned to an emissions unit in
the
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility
Profile</font> upon creation. This will be automatically included
in
the permit when the terms and conditions are generated and is not
editable except in the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility
Profile</font>. If it was necessary to update
an <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">EU ID</font>
in the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility
Profile</font> AFTER this <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit Detail</font>
page was
generated from the submittal of an application you will need to use the
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Sync EUs
with Facility</font> button to update the new <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">EU ID</font>
number(s)(see
below).
  </li>


  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Company
Equipment ID</font>- The term the facility uses internally to
identify the equipment. This is populated from the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility Detail</font>
but
can be edited, if necessary. This ID will be automatically included in
the permit, when the terms and conditions are generated, as it is
identified in this field.
  </li>


  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">EU
Permit Status</font>- Identifies the status of the permit, for
example
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Expired</font>
or <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Rescinded</font>.
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Extended</font>
indicates a timely renewal application was
submitted but the renewal permit was not issued prior to expiration. If
the emissions unit being created is new, the system will automatically
default the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">EU
Permit Status</font> to <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">None</font>.
The <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">EU
Permit Status</font> will
automatically be updated by the system as permits are issued or
revoked. The only time this field should be edited is if a permit
should be terminated, by selecting <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Terminate</font>
from the picklist. This
would occur after final issuance and only the DO/LAA Supervisor will
have the ability to edit in this case.
  </li>


  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">AQD
Description</font>- AQD description used to identify the
equipment.
This is populated from the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility Detail</font>
but can be edited, if
necessary. This ID will be automatically included in the permit, when
the terms and conditions are generated, as it is identified in this
field.This is not required in the system but is beneficial to
differentiate between similar emissions units at the facility. When
editing, this description should be short but specific.
  </li>


  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Install
Date</font>- The date that construction or changes began. This
field is not editable
but is automatically updated by the system when the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Begin
Installation/Modification Date</font> for the emissions unit is
entered into
the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility
Profile</font>.
  </li>


  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Terminated
Date</font>- A termination date can be
entered when a PTI or initial installation PTIO has not been acted on
for 18 months and no request for an extension has been made by the
facility. This would occur after final issuance and only the DO/LAA
Supervisor will have the ability to edit in this case.
  </li>


  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">General
Permit Category</font> - If a general permit is available and was
applied for this emissions unit, the higher level category will be
identified. For example, <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Readymix Concrete
Batch Plants</font>. If this
emissions unit will be issued as a general permit but the category or
type needs editing, you may select from a picklist when in edit mode.
If it is determined to be not applicable, this may also be selected.
  </li>


  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">General
Permit Type</font> - If a general permit is available and was
applied
for, for this emissions unit, the higher level category will be identified.
For example, <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Truck
Mix (GP4.1)</font>. The designation in parenthesis is the
unique identifier for that type of general permit. If this emissions
unit will be issued as a general permit but the category or type needs
editing, you may select from a picklist when in edit mode. If it is
determined to be not applicable, this may also be selected.
  </li>


  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Superseded
Permit</font>- Only available for PTI and PTIO permits
(superseding
for Title V permits occurs at the permit level as discussed below). If
a previously issued permit was applicable to the emissions unit, the
permit number is identified. The system will automatically default to
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">None</font>
but if a previously issued permit was applicable to the emissions
unit, the field will be editable and the permit number(s) will be
identified in a picklist. Select the appropriate permit number that
this permit will supersede. The superseded permit number will be
identified in the issued permit so it is very important to identify
this information.
  </li>


  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Superseded
Date</font>- If this permit has been superseded by another permit
for this emissions unit, the date will be identified after the
superseding permit is issued final.
  </li>


  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Fee
section</font>- Editable for
installation/modification permits not issued final to identify the
following fee information:
    
    <ul>


      <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Category</font>-
Identifies the fee category that
is applicable to the emissions unit.
      </li>


      <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Fee
Name</font>- The power or process
weight rate levels associated with a Category type.
      </li>


      <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Adjustment</font>-
Designates any alterations to the Base amount, for example Half for an
        <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Administrative
Modification</font>.
      </li>


      <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Base
Amount</font>- Auto-calculated by the
system, this is the designated fee charged to the owner or operator of
a facility based on the Category and Fee name prior to any adjustments
made to the fee.
      </li>


      <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Adjusted
Amount</font>- Auto-calculated by the system, the
amount that the owner or operator of a facility will be billed upon
final issuance of the PTI or PTIO (except when <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Full Cost Recovery</font>
is
selected from the third-level menu <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Fee Summary</font>).</li>


    
    </ul>


    
    <p>Note: these fees are not applicable to renewal PTIOs in
addition to TV
PTOs. The fields will be visible for a renewal PTIO <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit Detail</font>
page
but if anything other than $0 is entered you will not be able to save
the data.</p>

<h2>PTI and PTIO Permit Information</h2>


<p>To edit information located in this section, click on the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Edit</font>
button
at the bottom of the screen. Many of the editable fields contain a
check box. When editing, click on the text box to add or remove a check
mark. Information contained in these fields and the ability to edit,
when applicable, is discussed below.</p>


<ul>


  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Federally
Enforceable PTIO (FEPTIO)- </font>Only available for PTIO
permits.
When checked, this box indicates the emissions unit(s) in this permit
will be part of a federally enforceable limitation on potential-to-emit
necessitating issuance of an FEPTIO. If checked, an additional check
box indicates if the purpose of the limitation is to avoid Title V
applicability: <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">FEPTIO
to avoid Title V</font>. These are editable fields. </li>


  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Reason(s)</font>-
The <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Reason(s)</font>
for the permit is taken from the initial
application submittal. If you need to change the reason; while in edit
mode click on the checkmark next to the original designation to remove
it and then reassign a reason from the other choices by clicking on the
empty box. This will be necessary if you have duplicated the
permit/workflow for issuance of multiple permits from one application
(see the &#8220;Duplicating Permits&#8221; heading of this Help page). </li>


  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">General
Permit</font>- This option indicates if a general permit was
applied
for. This field can be edited if it is later determined during permit
review that a general permit is not applicable, or likewise is
available and applicable for the emissions unit(s) and the applicant

standards for general permits are not the same as a traditional permit.
If the applicant applied for a general permit and will now be issued an
individual permit, additional application information may be necessary.
Similarly, if the applicant applied for an individual permit and it was
discovered that a general permit is available, and desired by the
applicant, a Qualifying Criteria document will also be necessary. If
the applicability of a general permit is decided after the application
was submitted and this box is checked, you will need to return to the
emissions unit&#8217;s information and select a category and type. The
category and type fields will only be available for editing at the
emissions unit level AFTER this box is checked. </li>

<h2>Title V Permit Information</h2>


<p>To edit information located in this section, click on the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Edit</font>
button
at the bottom of the screen. Many of the editable fields contain a
check box. When editing, click on the text box to add or remove a check
mark. Information contained in these fields and the ability to edit,
when applicable, is discussed below.</p>


<ul>


  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Reason(s)
    </font>- The <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Reason(s)</font>
for the
permit is taken from the initial application submittal. If you need to
change the reason; while in edit mode click on the checkmark next to
the original designation to deselect it and then reassign a reason from
the other choices by clicking on the empty box. Multiple reasons can be
selected for a Title V permit. The most stringent issuance process will
be followed. This may be necessary, for example, if a facility submits
for a project where some changes qualify for a minor permit
modification (<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">MPM</font>)
and others a significant permit modification (<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">SPM</font>).
Another example would be if a facility is submitting a renewal
application and other modification applications are pending. In this
case, all changes could be rolled into the renewal permit. If other
applications exist for other modifications/requests, you must add the
other applications to this <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit Detail</font>
page. This is discussed under the &#8220;Application/Request Administrative
Permit Modifications&#8221; bullet of this section (see below). </li>


  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Description</font>
&#8211; This section is edited by the DO/LAA. The description
should be chosen carefully because it will be transferred into the
issued permit&#8217;s authorization page. </li>


  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">ERAC

  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Variance</font>
&#8211; This section is edited by the DO/LAA. Check the box if a
variance on operation will be included in the permit. </li>


  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Superseded
Permit</font>: If a previously issued permit was applicable to
the emissions
units, the permit number is identified. The system will automatically
default to <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">None</font>
but if a previously issued permit was applicable to the
emissions units, the field will be editable and the permit number(s)
will be identified in a picklist. Select the appropriate permit number
that this permit will supersede. The superseded permit number will be
identified in the issued permit so it is very important to identify
this information. </li>


  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">MACT,
NESHAP, and/or NSPS (federal rules)</font> &#8211; If one of the
federal
rules identified by the check boxes applies to the facility, and they

is determined as part of the application review that the federal rule
is not applicable, the check box can also be deselected. When adding
certain federal rules it will be necessary to also identify applicable
subpart(s) via a picklist generated when the box is checked. Select <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Add

shown as
applicable and it is determined to not apply, select the subpart by
placing a check mark in the box and click <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Delete Selected

that a public hearing be held. This is an editable field if it is
determined to apply. </li>


  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Statement

by clicking the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Description</font>
that appears as a hyperlink. The file will
be opened using the same software that was used to generate the terms
and conditions. You can make changes to the terms and conditions but
you must save the document to your hard/network drive and then upload
the document, if the permit has not been issued final, through the
third-level menu <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Terms

<h2>Bottom Page Buttons</h2>


<ul>


  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Edit</font>-
allows you to <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Edit</font>
fields that are editable. While in
edit mode
only two buttons will be displayed at the bottom of the page, <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Save
changes</font> or <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Discard
changes</font>. Use these buttons before moving on to other
screens in the system. </li>


  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Sync
EUs with Facility</font>- This button is used to update the
emissions
unit IDs (e.g., B001) for the emissions units that will be issued in
the permit to match those found in the current <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility Detail</font>.
If the
permit writer gets an error during the DO/LAA sign off workflow task
completion that indicated: "EU ID out of sync"; the permit writer
should go to the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit
Detail</font> page and click <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Sync EUs with Facility</font>.
Doing this will ensure the emissions unit IDs that will be issued in
the permit match those found in the current <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility Detail</font>
and it
will be necessary to do this if you receive the error message that your
permit has emissions units ID's out of sync. This situation could occur
when an emissions unit ID is updated/changed to a different ID than
existed when the permit object was first generated. </li>


  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Add/Remove
EUs</font>- Click on this button, select from a list
and either <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Add
EUs</font>
or <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Remove EUs</font>
that are associated with this permit. Please see

for the set of emissions units. This
name will appear in the permit document. To add emissions units to the
group, select the emissions unit from the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Available EUs</font>
and select <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Move</font>
to add it to the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Current
EUs</font>. To remove, select the emissions unit from
the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Current
EUs</font> and select <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Remove</font>
to move it to the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Available
EUs</font>.
Select <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Save
changes or Discard changes</font>. You will automatically be
returned to the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit
Detail</font> page where you will see the grouped
emissions units identified under a grouped icon on the Facility Tree. </li>


  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Dead-end</font>-
This button is used to end the permit process,
for example,
if the facility is withdrawing an application. A dead-ended permit may
be reactivated again but only by a systems administrator; therefore
caution should be maintained. It will be necessary to cancel the
workflow associated with a permit that is dead-ended. See the Help page
for third-level menu &#8220;Cancel&#8221; of the &#8220;Workflow Diagram&#8221; second-level
tab.
  </li>


  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Deny
Permit</font>- This button is used to
acknowledge a permit denial process will be initiated. Selecting this
button will not automatically start a denial workflow, rather the
permit writer will also need to select the denial process as part of
the workflow task for the specific permit action. Once <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Deny Permit</font>
is
selected, the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit
Detail</font> page will then display an <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Un-Deny</font>
button
(see below). </li>


  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Un-Deny
Permit</font>- Only visible when the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Deny Permit</font>
option
was
selected. Selecting this button allows you to reverse the denial
process. </li>


  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Change
to PTI</font>- Only available for PTIO permits. Select if
you want to
change the permit from a PTIO to a PTI. This would be applicable if the
facility is in transition from the non-Title V program (PTIO) to the

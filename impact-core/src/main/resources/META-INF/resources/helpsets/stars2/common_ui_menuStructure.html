<h1>Screen Layout &amp; Menu Structure</h1> 
<h2>Overview</h2> 
<P>
</p><p>This page describes the common layout of the web pages in this system, including the menus 
and cues that control how you move about within the system.  Every page in the system is laid out  
like the page presented here, so once you become familiar with this navigation strategy, you 
will be able to work in the system with very little difficulty.</p>

<p>The figure below illustrates this layout 
and the sections that follow describe each of the numbered items on the screen.<br> 
<br>
<div align="center">
<img src="images/menus.jpg"  alt="Common Page Layout in IMPACT System">
<p><a name="page_layout_figure"></a><strong>Common Page Layout</strong></p>
</div>
<p><br></p>

<p>This topic contains the following sections which correspond to the numerical markers 
in the figure above:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#header">Screen Header</a></li>
<li><a href="#tabs">First-level Menu:  Tabs</a></li>
<li><a href="#2nd-level">Second-level Menu</a></li>
<li><a href="#3rd-level">Third-level Menu</a></li>
<li><a href="#footer_links">Footer Links</a></li>
<li><a href="#breadcrumbs">Breadcrumbs</a></li>
<li><a href="#content">Content Area</a></li>
</ol>

<p>
The screen layout described here applies to all the content screens for this sytem; that is, the screens the provide information
and access to operations for you to perform.  
<!-- Help-on-help removed from TOC per AQD; no page such as that referenced here.
The screens associated with the 'Help' sub-system are laid out somewhat differently.
These are described on the <a href="help_overview.html"><font color="#ff0000">???</font></a> page of the 'Help' sub-system.
 -->
 <p>
<!--  ********** HEADER SECTION *********** -->  
<a name="header"></a><br><br>
<h2>Screen Header</h2>
<p>At the top of each screen you see a header or <a class="glossary-link" href="glossary.html/#banner" target="_blank">banner</a> that consists of three parts:  the Ohio EPA logo,   
a welcome message, and three navigation links that provide short-cuts to locations you may want to   
reach easily.  The screen header looks like this:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="images/pg_header.jpg" alt="Screen Header / Banner">
<p><b>Screen Header (also referred to as "banner")</b></p>
</div>
<p> 
This header appears in addition to any header or banner  that is provided by  
the e-Business Center through which you may have accessed the system.  Note that the first  
<a class="glossary-link" href="glossary.html/#hyperlink" target="_blank">hyperlink</a> in the 
header, <font face="Courier New">epaPortal</font>, is a link to the login page of that portal, which provides you easy  
access to EPA applications and services outside of AQD. 
<p> 
The second link in the header, <font face="Courier New">Help</font>, takes you to specialized, 
page-specific information that 
provides you with help for whatever page you access it from, including all the operations 
available on that page.  So, for instance, 
if you click <font face="Courier New">Help</font>from 
the <font face="Courier New">Facilities --&gt; Facility Detail</font> page, a pop-up window 
will give you information about that page, including the meaning of the information you see 
on that page, and the activities and operations you can perform from that page.
</p>
<p> Clicking the final header link, <font face="Courier New">Logout,</font> which is available on 
every page in the system, logs you out of the IMPACT System and returns you to the location from
which you entered the system.&nbsp;
You should always <font face="Courier New">Logout</font> of the system when you complete
your work for that session.  (Be sure to save what you're working on so that it will be
available to you when you come back to the system at a later time.)</p>

<p>
<!--  ************ TABS SECTION *********** -->  
<a name="tabs"></a><br><br>
<h2>First-level Menu : Tabs<br></h2>
<p>
Just below the page header, you will find a series of tabs that go across the screen.
These tabs are also referred to as the 
<!-- GLOSSARY ENTRY -->
<a class="glossary-link" href="glossary.html/#first-level_menu">first-level menu</a>.  
The tabs, which look like the tabs you would ordinarily see in a notebook, give you access to the different sub-systems that provide the functionality that
the system delivers to you through this web application.  You may not see all of the tabs
on your screen when you login to the system.  You will only see the tabs that provide access
to operations you are allowed to execute, based on your 
<!-- GLOSSARY ENTRY --> <a class="glossary-link" href="glossary.html/#systemRole" target="_blank">system role</a>.
The tabs look like this:</p>
<img src="images/tabs.jpg" alt="First-level menu:  Tabs">
<p>The highlighted tab is the tab that you selected, or that the system has moved you 
to as a result of something you selected in another menu or a link you clicked on in a data table.</p>
<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>

<p> 
<!--  *********** SECOND-LEVEL MENU SECTION  ******************** -->
<br><br><a name="2nd-level"></a>
<h2>Second-level Menu</h2>
<p>You will find the <a class="glossary-link" href="glossary.html/#level2-menu" target="_blank">second-level menu</a> immediately below the first-level menu tabs on each screen.   
This menu shows you the operations that you have available under the selected tab.  The second-level  
menu choices are different under each tab.  The figures below illustrate the second-level menus 
for two different tabs.&nbsp; Only the menu items applicable to the choices currently selected on the screen are visible.<br></p>
<div align="center">
<img src="images/level2-facilities.jpg" alt="Second-level Menus (For facilities tab)">
<p>
<b>Second-level Menu Choices for the <font face="Courier New">Facilities</font> Tab</b>
</div>The item that is  
associated with the 'current' page is highlighted, in this case <font face="Courier New">Facility Search</font>.  Menu items
that are available, but not currently selected are fully visible, but not highlighted, for example
<font face="Courier New">Facility History Search</font> through <font face="Courier New">Change Facility ID</font>.  The <font face="Courier New">Facility Detail</font> menu item is
'faded out', since it is not a valid choice unless and until a single facility has been
selected.
<p>Similarly, the second-level menu items that appear when the Workflow tab is selected are shown
below:
<div align="center">
<img src="images/level2-workflow.jpg" alt="Second-level Manu (for Workflow Tab)">
<p>
<b>Second-level Menu Choices for the <font face="Courier New">Workflow</font> Tab</b>
</div>
<p>As on the <font face="Courier New">Facilities</font> second-level menu illustrated above, there is a menu item highlighted (<font face="Courier New">Workflow Search</font>), 
another available, but not 
highlighted (<font face="Courier New">Summary Charts</font>) and two choices that are not available, since they apply only when
you have selected a single workflow (in the case of <font face="Courier New">Workflow Diagram</font>) or workflow task (in the case of 
<font face="Courier New">Task Profile</font>)
</p>
<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>

<p>
<!--  ********** THIRD-LEVEL MENU SECTION  *********************** --> 
<br><br><a name="3rd-level"></a>
<h2>Third-level Menu</h2>
<p>Third-level menu items, if applicable for any particular screen, appear as a bullet list in a 
panel at the left of the screen.  Each bullet item represents an operation or set of information
that may be available, depending upon your previous selections and/or your <a class="glossary-link"
href="glossary.html/#systemRole" target="__blank">system role</a>.  The operations that are listed depend 
on which tab is selected.  
<p>An example of a third-level menu, 
in this case for the Permits tab is illustrated below.</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="images/level3-permits.jpg" alt="Third-level Menu (for Permits Tab)">
<p>
<b>Third-level Menu Choices for the <font face="Courier New">Permits</font> Tab</b>
</div>
<p>In addition, only the operations that apply to the specific object
for which you have chosen to view detail data are available and selectable; that is, only those operations
that are underlined in the third-level menu are active <a class="glossary-link"
href="glossary.html/#hyperlinks" target="__blank">hyperlinks</a>. For example above, in the figure above, the <font face="Courier New">Denial  
Issuance</font>&nbsp; link is only active if the permit being viewed has been denied;  <font face="Courier New">Fee Summary</font> is only available  
if the referenced permit has been issued and invoiced. </p>
<p>
<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>

<p>
<!--  ********** FOOTER SECTION  ********************************** --> 
<a name="footer_links"></a><br><br>
<h2>Hyperlinks in the Screen Footer</h2>
<p>The system provides access to a lot of information and many automated as well as tracking  
operations for your use.  As a result,  
you may have to use the scroll bars at the right and on the bottom of the screens in order to  
access all the information and operation buttons that the system presents. on a particular screen.&nbsp;    
For convenience, the  
system provides short-cuts in the footer at the bottom of the screen to each tab (first-level menu item)   
and to each of the hyperlinks that appear in the screen header.  This saves you from having   
to scroll back up to the top of the screen in order to access those menus and links.  The figure   
below illustrates the common footer.&nbsp;<br></p>
<div align="center">
<img src="images/footer-permits.jpg" alt="Screen Footer on a Permits screen">
<p>
<b>Common Footer Hyperlinks&nbsp;</b>
</div>
<p>In this figure, you can tell that this  
footer was taken from a screen under the <font face="Courier New">Permits</font> tab 
because the Permits link is highlighted . 
<a href="#top"><br></a></p><p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a> 
 
</p><p>
<!--  ********** BREADCRUMBS *************************************** -->
<a name="breadcrumbs"></a><br><br>
<h2>Breadcrumbs</h2>
<p>Breadcrumbs are a common mechanism for web pages to show you what selections you made
in previous menus in order to reach
the page you are currently viewing.   In this system, the breadcrumbs appear below the 
second-level menu and to the right of the third-level menu.  In the example shown below, 
the first level menu choice, <font face="Courier New">Facilities</font>, and the second-level menu choice, <font face="Courier New">Facility Detail</font>
are highlighted in the appropriate menus as well as shown as a navigation path in the
breadcrumbs.  The third-level menu choice, <font face="Courier New">Emission Units</font>, which is also highlighted in the menu,  
appears as the title for the 
information page.&nbsp; 
</p>
<br>
<div align="center">
<img src="images/breadcrumbs.jpg" alt="Breadcrumbs">
<p> 
<b>Breadcrumbs for the Navigation Path <font face="Courier New">Facilities --&gt; Facility Detail --&gt; Emission Units</font> 
</b></p>
<br> 
</div>
You can select any of the items in the breadcrumb navigation path to return to the 
screen at that level of the menu.

<p>
<!--  ********** CONTENT AREA ************************************** -->
<a name="content"></a><br><br>
<h2>Content Area</h2>
<p>The content area of the screen is everything you see between the page title shown 
in the above figure and the hyperlinks 
in the <a class="glossary-link" href="#footer_links">footer</a> described above, whether or not there is a 
third-level menu visible on the page you are currently viewing.  This area of the screen presents
the available information about the entity you have selected.  In some cases, there are multiple
screens associated with the entity.  The first screen you see is the highest level, or most
general, data for your selection.  The content area of the screen is 
described in detail 
in the <a href="common_ui_detailData.html">Detail Data</a> help topic.

<h1>Detail Data Pages</h1>
<h2>Overview </h2>
<p>This Help topic describes the general layout and common features 
of pages in the system that provide Detail Data about an object or entity for 
which data is  
stored in the system.  Most artifacts in the system, including 
<font face="Courier New">Facilities,</font>   
<font face="Courier New">Applications</font>,   
Requests for Permitting Action,   
<font face="Courier New">Permits</font>,   
<font face="Courier New">Emissions Inventories</font>,  
 and <font face="Courier New">Compliance Reports</font> offer such pages.      
You can access Detail Data for an object by clicking on the identifier link, 
for example a 
<font face="Courier New">Report ID</font>, for an instance of that 
object    
in a datagrid, a tree or any other summary screen. 
</p> 
<p>Detail Data screens have similar general layouts and some common features.      
Each includes entity-specific 
<a href="#hi-level_data">high-level data</a> for a single 
instance of an object.&nbsp; Lower-level data be available for some
objects through    
third-level menu links or nodes in a <a href="#tree_control">tree</a> 
that may
appear on the screen with the high-level data.
The <a href="common_ui_menuStructure.html">Page Layout &amp; Menu Structure
</a> Help topic page describes and illustrates the common 
third-level menu element and illustrates the position of the 
content area with
respect to that menu, the tree control and other common screen elements.
</p>
<!--   
The always-visible data is set off by a content title 
(in this example, 
<font face="Courier New">Permit Information</font>).  Additionally, more 
detailed data is often available in  
screen regions that are <a href="common_ui_elements_collapsibleRegions.html">
collapsed</a> 
while other information may appear in 
<a href="common_ui_elements_datagrids.html">datagrids</a>.&nbsp; 
The operations buttons appear at the bottom of the content area on the 
screen.&nbsp;  
Some operation buttons may be grayed-out, indicating either that you are not 
authorized to  
perform that action, or the action.&nbsp; You may find additional informa 
does not apply to 
the current state of your selections.&nbsp; Depending upon the object which 
the data 
describes, you may also see a tree structure and/or a lower- (also called a 
third-) level 
menu through which you can access even more information</p>
-->
<p>Each Detail Data page also provides you the opportunity,   
with  
<a href="#buttons">Operations Buttons</a>, to    
enter and/or modify data shown on the page, and to perform
other context-specific operations.  For objects that include
tree representations, you may also access a Detail
Data page (and its associated operations buttons) 
by selecting a node in the tree for the object of interest.  
(See the 
<a href="#tree_control">Tree Control</a>  
section below for more information on that usage.)     
Some Detail Data  
pages also provide the capability for you to view, add or delete 
 Attachments related to an object, 
either directly
 on the Detail Page, or via a third-level menu item.  
 These capabilities are      
covered in separate Help topics, accessible via the preceding links or those 
listed  
in <a href="#rel_help">  
Related Help Topics.</a></p>
<p>Figure 1 below presents an overview of the Facility Detail Page 
(also called the  
initial Facility Detail page).  This is certainly the most complex Detail 
Data page 
in the system.&nbsp; Consequently, it illustrates the data and
 operations 
components 
discussed in the remainder of this Help topic, as well as the page links above  
and those in the <a href="#rel_help">Related Help Topics</a> section below.

 <p>Note that not all Detail Data pages offer all of the data screen sectors 
described here, but most are common   
 to at least several such pages. They will work the same on any Detail Data 
page on which they are offered.<br></p>

<!--  ********** Tree Control  ************************************** -->
<h2><a name="tree_control"><br>Tree Control</a></h2> 
<p>
On some screens, specifically those presenting information
about your facility, an issued permit, an emissions inventory or a
permit application,
the system provides a tree view of the object you are looking at.    
The tree gives you direct access to information about each object that
is represented by a node in the tree,   
as well as   
providing a comprehensive summary of the object you are looking at. Figure 7   
illustrates a portion of a facility tree that might appear in the tree region 
in <a href="#detail_data_overview_figure">Figure 1</a>.
<p>
<div align="center">
<img src="images/treeRegion.jpg"  alt="Facility Tree Example">
<br><br><b>Figure 3: Portion of a Facility Tree</b><br>
</div>
 
<p>The tree control is covered in more detail on the 
<a href="common_ui_detailData.html">Common User Interface --&gt; Detail Data</a> and 
the <a href="facility_tree.html">Facility Tree</a> Help topic pages, the latter 
of<br>which includes a table describing the icons 
you will see in the trees.   
<!--  replace if we ever do icon legend page 
The 
<a href="icon_legend.html">Common User Interface -&gt; 
Icon Legend</a> provides 
a list of the icons used in all the tree representations in the system,  
along with explanations of their meaning when used in different contexts.</p>
<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>

<!-- ********** High-level entity data ************ -->
<h2><a href="hi-level_data"></a><br>High-level Data</h2>
<p>The topmost region of the <a href="common_ui_menuStructure.html/#content">Content 
Area</a> 
displays high-level information about the object, such as identification, 
status, and the  
most salient data items for that object.  Normally, this region is always 
visible.   
Identified with a double green line (<img src="images/double-green line.jpg" alt="double green line">)
in <a href="#detail_data_overview_figure">Figure 1</a>, 
the high-level 
information is presented between the 
<font face="Courier New">Facility Information</font> 
page title and the title of the following screen region (in this case, 
<font face="Courier New">Facility Details</font>). It presents various data items
related to the entity.  Clearly, the data presented depends upon the object.  
For example, as illustrated in <a href="#detail_data_overview_figure">Figure 1</a>,
the <font face="Courier New">Facility Detail</font> detail page includes
facility location information, classification and status information, and
compliance reporting due dates.</p> 

<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>

<!-- ********** Labeled Data Regions BOOKMARK************ -->
<h2><a name="data_regions"></a><br>Collapsible Data Regions</h2>
<p>One or more collapsible
screen regions often follow the always-visible topmost screen region. 
These regions contain additional data grouped for ease of understanding 
and use.  
Icons adjacent to
the region title allow the user to expand(<img src="images/expand.jpg" 
alt="Expand-region icon">) or collapse (<img src="images/collapse.jpg" alt="Collapse-region icon" >) 
the region. Expanding any collapsed screen regions reveals the additional 
information displyed in the region.  In the example in 
<a href="#detail_data_overview_figure">
Figure 1</a>, the <font face="Courier New">Facility Details</font> region 
is populated, but collapsed so the data is not immediately visible. 
<font face="Courier New">Facility Details</font> region is 
  
Expanding the <font face="Courier New">Facility Details</font> region 
reveals the following data:   
</p>
<p>
<a name="figure 4"></a>
<div align="center">
<img src="images/facility_detailExpanded.jpg" alt="Facility Detail
screen region - expanded"><br>
<b>Figure 4: Faciity Detail Screen Region - Expanded</b>
</div>

<p>Frequently the 
page will have a  
collapsible screen region devoted to <a href="common_ui_attachments.html">Attachments</a>,  
documents you may attach to certain objects 
in the system, and one devoted to <a href="common_ui_notes.html">Notes</a>.  Notes and Attachments 
are covered in detail in other Help topic pages. 
</p> 
   
<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>

<!-- ********** Operations Buttons BOOKMARK************ -->
<h2><a name="buttons"></a><br>Operations Buttons</h2>
<p>  
At the bottom of each Detail Data screen, the system offers 
operations buttons appropriate 
to the object.  
Most screens will have some combination of the common operations 
buttons including <img src="images/btn_edit.jpg"
alt="Edit button">, <img src="images/btn_validate.jpg" alt="Validate button">,
and <img src="images/btn_submit.jpg" alt="Submit button"> buttons 
described in <a href="common_ui_editMode/#buttons">Entering and Editing
Data --&gt; Operations Buttons</a> as well as context-sensitive
buttons appropriate to 
the object, such as the 
<img src="images/btn_preserveCurrentProfile.jpg" alt="Preserve Current Profile button">, 
<img src="images/btn_showProfileReport.jpg" alt="Show Profile Report button">, 
<img src="images/btn_createEmissionsUnit.jpg" alt="Create Emissions Unit button">,
<img src="images/btn_createControlEquipment.jpg" alt="Create Control Equipment button">,
and <img src="images/btn_createEgressPoint.jpg" alt="Create Release Point button"> 
buttons you see on the <font face="Courier New">Facility Detail</font> 
Detail Data screen illustrated in <a href="#detail_data_overview_figure">Figure 1</a>
and <a href="#facility_detailExpanded.jpg">Figure 4</a>.
  Each of these 
buttons executes an automatic operation, or moves to a screen for further 
user-input or action to complete the operation named on the button. 
You will find similar context-sensitive operations
buttons (to perform for different operations) on the detail data 
screen for each object in the system</p> 

<p>Some operation buttons may be grayed-out, 
indicating
 that the action does not apply to the current state of the object.

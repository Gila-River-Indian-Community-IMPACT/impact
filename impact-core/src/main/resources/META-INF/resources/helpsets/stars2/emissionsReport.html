<h1>Emissions Inventory Detail</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This Help page discusses the information fields you see on the
<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Emissions
Inventory</font> page of the system and provides assistance on how
to
use the electronic system to review, and when applicable edit,
emissions inventories.</p>

<p>The <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Emissions
Inventory</font> page is the electronic
depiction of all of the emissions inventory information submitted by a
facility, whether in the Title V, Synthetic Minor Title V, or Non-Title
V emissions reporting category, except basic facility information which
is contained in the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility
Profile</font>.</p>

<p>Emissions inventories submitted
through the system may be comprised of three parts; FER (Facility
Emissions Inventory), ES (Emissions Statement) and EIS (Emissions
Inventory Summary). For Title V facilities, a FER and EIS will be
submitted every year. For Synthetic Minor Title V facilities a FER will
be submitted every year and an EIS may be submitted, if desired. For
Non-Title V facilities, a FER will be submitted every two years. For
ALL three types of facilities, an ES is submitted with the FER and EIS,
when applicable, if the facility resides in a non-attainment county and
the facility emits greater than 25 tons per year of NOx AND/OR VOC.</p>

<p>The list of pollutants contained in the emissions inventories is
compiled from
a list that appears in the National Emissions Inventory (NEI) pollutant
reference table, Ohio EPA&#8217;s old permitting and reporting application
(STARS) and Section 114 Right to Know program.</p>

<p>The emissions factor
list originates from Web FIRE. Only uncontrolled and un-revoked Web
FIRE records are considered in the original compilation of emissions
factors. The factors are processed to achieve consistency with
reporting units, measures and material codes within each Source
Classification Code (SCC). Since there are significant emissions
factors gaps in Web FIRE, Ohio EPA intends to identify and fill a
significant number of those gaps in the future using all available
resources. The system&#8217;s emissions factors table is a dynamic list and
it will be updated once a year with the most up to date factors.</p>

<p>This Help page will not provide guidance or assistance with
the emissions
inventory review process in general, for example determining if the
facility chose the method that is best to determine emissions unit
actual emissions.</p>

<p>Title V and Synthetic Minor Title V emissions inventories
are required to be submitted through this electronic system by the
facility; whereas non-Title V emissions inventories may be submitted as an
option. If a non-Title V emissions inventory is submitted as a &#8220;hard copy&#8221;
rather than through IMPACT, Ohio EPA Central Office staff will
enter it electronically upon receipt. This is applicable to new
emissions inventories or any needed revised emissions inventories.</p>

<p>The only emissions inventories that can be viewed by Ohio EPA are
those
that have been <u>submitted</u> through IMPACT, or
those that were
submitted in hard copy form and are entered electronically by Ohio EPA
staff. If a facility is entering and saving emissions inventory
information in IMPACT, it will not be viewable by Ohio EPA until
it has been submitted.</p>

<p>The contents of these emissions inventory pages will differ
depending on
the type of emissions inventory you are working with.</p>

<h2>Facility Detail Updates by the Facility</h2>

<p>The first step for all facilities submitting emissions inventories
<u>EXCEPT
Non-Title V emissions inventories</u>, is to ensure the information
in their
<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility
Profile</font> is correct. All emissions inventories are linked
directly
to the current <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility
Profile</font> that exists in the database. The
<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility
Profile</font> will include, but is not limited to, created
emissions
units, control equipment, processes, and release points. Please note in
order to have submitted an emissions inventory, each emissions unit in the
<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility
Profile</font> must have an emissions process with an SCC
associated
with the emissions unit (except Non-Title V emissions inventories). Also,
other information from the emissions unit, control equipment and release
point pages are used in the emissions inventory. Only those valid
emissions unit(s) contained in the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility Detail</font>
for your specific
reporting year would have been included in the emissions inventories. In
some cases it may have been necessary to use a historic <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility
Profile</font>, for example when submitting a revised emissions
inventory for a
historical year. In those cases, the emissions unit(s) that existed at
that time would have needed to be included in the emissions inventory.
Note, Non-Title V emissions inventories are not associated with a <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility
Profile</font>.</p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
<a name="eg_71"></a></p>

<h2>Engineering Guide 71</h2>

<p>Engineering Guide 71 provides information to help the facility
determine if an emissions unit is exempt from emissions reporting. When
the facility identifies that an emissions unit is <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Exempt because
Engineering Guide #71</font>, under the emissions unit specific
summary page,
it will disable all required emissions reporting for this emissions
inventory. Any emissions unit in the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility Detail</font>
associated with the
emissions inventory that is identified as De Minimis will automatically be
exempt from emissions reporting and; therefore the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Exempt because
Engineering Guide #71</font> checkbox will already be checked.</p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
<a name="locating"></a></p>

<h2>Locating and Viewing an Electronic Emissions Inventory</h2>

<p>You can locate an emissions inventory and access an <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Emissions
Inventory
Detail</font> page throughout many of the system pages, most
usually through
the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Emissions
Inventory Search</font> or <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility Detail</font>
pages.</p>

<ul>

  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility
Profile</font> -&gt; <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Emissions Inventories</font>
third-level
menu will
display a datagrid of all emissions inventories for the specific facility.
  </li>

  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Emissions
Inventory Search</font> allows you to search for available
emissions
inventories using many different search criteria. This feature is available
on the opening page for the first-level menu called <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Emissions Inventories</font>.
For Help on this feature, refer to the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Emissions Inventory
Search</font> Help
page. Emissions inventories that fit the search criteria you have set will
show up in the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Request
List</font> datagrid after you have performed an
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Emissions
Inventories Search</font>.</li>

</ul>

<p>Using either method, the datagrid will contain a column with
the <font color="#996633"><u>Inventory
Id</u></font> which is hyperlinked to the specific <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Emissions Inventory
Detail</font> page.
Click on the <font color="#996633"><u>Inventory Id</u></font>.</p>

<p>Also note the datagrid will contain a column with the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">FP Id</font>.
This is
the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility
Profile</font> identification number for the specific version of
the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility
Profile</font> associated with the emissions inventory when
submitted. If the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">FP
Id</font> is not identified as &#8220;current&#8221; then the
emissions inventory is associated with a historical profile. You can click
on the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">FP Id</font>
hyperlink to view the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility
Profile</font> associated with the
emissions inventory. If you see the message; <font color="red"><b>**
Note this Inventory is
associated with a Historical Facility Detail version. ** </b></font>,
you will
know you are not viewing the current <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility Detail</font>.</p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
<a name="header"></a></p>

<h2>Emissions Inventory Header Information</h2>

<p>At the top of each of the emissions inventory pages discussed
below you
will see a header with general information about the facility and the
specific emissions inventory you are viewing. This information includes
the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Reporting
Category, Reporting Year</font> and <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Emissions Inventory Number</font>.
You will also
find information regarding submittal and processing by Ohio EPA: <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Submit
Date, Approved Date</font> and <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Reporting State</font>.</p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
<a name="detail"></a></p>

<h2>Title V and Synthetic Minor Title V Emissions Inventory Detail
Data Fields</h2>

<p><a name="tree"></a></p>

<h3>Emissions Inventory Tree</h3>

<div align="left">
<p><img alt="Emissions Inventory Tree" src="images/emissions_report_tree.jpg" title="Emissions Inventory Tree" style="border: 1px solid ;" vspace="4"></p>

</div>

<p>The Emissions Inventory Tree contains a list of emissions
unit(s), or
groupings of, associated with the facility and emissions process(es)
associated with the emissions unit(s). Only those emissions units
contained in the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility
Profile</font> associated with the emissions inventory
that were identified as operating for any portion of the reporting
period were included in the Emissions Inventory Tree. The emissions
unit(s) are denoted by the symbol&nbsp;<img alt="Emissions Unit Icon" src="images/eu.gif" height="24" width="28"> (EU Id icon) while the process(es)
are denoted by the symbol&nbsp;<img alt="Process Icon" src="images/icon_process.jpg" height="15" width="19">
(process icon).</p>

<p>When completing an emissions
inventory, the facility had the ability to group certain emission
unit/process combinations. When this is done the grouped emissions
units:processes will be represented by the symbol&nbsp;<img alt="Group Icon" src="images/icon_group.jpg" height="13" width="19"> (group icon) and the
specific process will no longer be identified under the emissions unit.
If they have more than one process with the same SCC code that shares
the same downstream control equipment and release point they can create
a grouping of the processes which allows them to enter emissions
information one time for the entire group. Within IMPACT, the
processes that can be grouped are limited to those that have the same
SCC code and have exactly the same downstream equipment (control
equipment and release points). Please keep in mind, this does not imply
the equipment is of the same type but rather is the exact same piece of
physical equipment (e.g., two emissions units <u>share</u>
one control device
and release point). Furthermore, it will have be necessary for the
facility to determine which of the potential grouped process
combinations are qualified for the grouping in accordance with
Engineering Guide 72.</p>

<p>Clicking on an EU Id icon will generate the specific <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Emissions
Unit
XXXX Summary</font> page, clicking on a group icon will generate
the specific
<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Emissions
Unit Group XXXX Summary</font> page, while clicking on the
process
icon will generate the specific <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Process &amp;
Emissions Detail</font>
page. On these pages you can view specific information about the
emissions unit and process and their emissions reporting information.
At any point you can click on the Inventory Id&nbsp;<img alt="Inventory ID" src="images/report_id.jpg" height="21" width="142"> at the top of the Emissions
Inventory Tree to return to the Emissions Inventory page.</p>

<p>Note, next to the Inventory Id and EU id (or Group Id) will be
the amount,
specified in <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Ton</font>,
of emissions that have been reported.</p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
<a name="summary"></a></p>

<h3>Emissions Inventory Summary</h3>

<p>The first page of the emissions inventory, when at the top level
of the
Emissions Inventory Tree,&nbsp;<img alt="Inventory ID" src="images/report_id.jpg" height="21" width="142">
, is the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Emissions
Inventory Summary </font>section which
contains:</p>

<ul>

  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Inventories
Included</font>: This section contains three check boxes;
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">FER</font>
(Fee
Emissions Inventory), <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">ES</font>
(Emissions Statement) and <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">EIS</font>
(Emissions
Inventory Summary). When a facility uses IMPACT, the system will
automatically check the boxes that <u>may be</u>
applicable to their facility
for that reporting year.
    <p>Synthetic Minor Title V facilities may choose
to select the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">EIS</font>
box if they choose to report this information (it is
not required). If they check the EIS box, it may add additional
pollutants to their list for reporting.</p>

    <p>IMPACT also automatically
identifies <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">ES</font>
as applicable if their facility is located in a
non-attainment county. It is up to the facility to determine if they
emit greater than 25 tons per year of NOx AND/OR VOC. If they determine
this is not the case, they can uncheck the ES box.</p>

  </li>

  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility
Emissions</font>: This section is automatically populated
by the system to
provide a summed total of emissions reported for the entire facility
based on the actual emissions entered for each applicable emissions
unit&#8217;s process, as discussed below.
  </li>

  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Attachments</font>:
This section is
where they attach any necessary documents to the emissions inventory. The
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Attachment
Type</font> (public) and <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Trade Secret Document</font>
(trade) columns of
the datagrid are hyperlinks that allow you to view the document once
uploaded. You will be able to click on the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Trade Secret

hyperlink to view the justification. You must be granted access to view
the trade secret information.
    <p>If necessary, you also have the ability
to attach a document by clicking <img alt="Add Button" src="images/btn_add.jpg" height="20" width="42">.
When this button is clicked the
following pop-up window will appear with the ability to add both public

summary information about the process. The second section is
information regarding the material, operating schedule and throughput.
The third section is where you will view the emissions information for
each pollutant and Air Service will have calculated the emissions that
will comprise the final emissions inventory.</p>

one of the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Material</font>
choices which is valid for their process.
    <p>The emissions factor calculations performed by the system
are dependent
upon the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Throughput</font>

<h4>Process Emissions or Group Emissions (third section)</h4>

<p>This section contains a datagrid of pollutants where the
facility
entered emissions information and IMPACT calculated their
emissions. All emissions fee and criteria pollutants will ALWAYS appear
in the datagrid regardless of applicability to their process. Beginning
with reporting year 2008, Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs) will appear
in the pollutants section for the first time. Only those HAPs that are
identified as related to their process (based on Ohio EPA&#8217;s generic
list of emissions factor(s)) are populated in the datagrid. For their
convenience, the system picks the generic emissions factors for HAPs
when it populates the datagrid. They were asked to review the emissions
estimate for HAPs and if necessary change the default emissions factor,
or they could have added additional pollutants to the list.</p>

<p>For each pollutant they were required to enter a value. If the
pollutant has zero emissions to be reported, they were instructed to
enter &#8220;0&#8221; rather than leaving the value blank/empty. If <u>ALL</u>
pollutants
for a specific process were to be reported as &#8220;0&#8221;, rather than entering
&#8220;0&#8221; for each pollutant they have the option to enter &#8220;0&#8221; in either the
<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Throughput</font>
column of the material and throughput information datagrid,
OR, they could enter &#8220;0&#8221; in the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Hours Per Year</font>
box in the operating
schedule information section (they did not need to do both). Then, it
would <u>NOT</u> have been necessary to enter <u>ANY</u>
other information on the
<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Process
&amp; Emissions Detail</font> page for that process.</p>

<p>Calculations are performed by the system based on a variety of
information contained in the system&#8217;s databases including the emissions
factor and the emissions unit information identified in the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility
Profile</font> (e.g., control equipment efficiency). If the
resultant
emissions based on the calculations performed in they system are not
accurate or do not represent the facility&#8217;s actual emissions, they were
instructed to revise the information contained in their <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility
Profile</font> and/or use different factors than the default
values. If they
selected an &#8220;emissions&#8221; method, they were instructed to attach a
spreadsheet showing what was used to calculate the emissions.</p>

<p>Note, in the $ column a checkbox indicates that pollutant is
subject to the FER
component of this inventory.</p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
<a name="method"></a></p>

<h5>Method Used</h5>

<p>The <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Method
Used</font> column identifies the type of method the facility
used
for calculating emissions for EACH pollutant. Methods are categorized
as either &#8220;emissions&#8221; or &#8220;factor&#8221; methods. Selecting an &#8220;emissions&#8221;
method required entry of the actual fugitive and stack emissions based
on their own calculations, which are added to determine the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Total</font>.
Selecting a &#8220;factor&#8221; method required entry of the uncontrolled hours of
operation and sometimes an uncontrolled emissions factor value and the
system automatically calculates the fugitive and stack emissions values
based on these values and the data contained in the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility Detail</font>.
For any &#8221;factor&#8221; method, the amount of uncontrolled emissions are
calculated from <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Throughput</font>
amount multiplied by the factor. Note that
the unit of the factor is pounds per unit of throughput (<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">X units</font>).
The
control equipment and release points described in the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility Detail</font>
associated with this process are examined to determine the ultimate
emissions.</p>

<p>For both &#8220;emissions&#8221; or &#8220;factor&#8221; methods the following options
are
available:</p>

<ul>

  <li>CEM (continuous emissions monitoring)- where it is
required by a permit and this data is readily available and specific to
the facility,
  </li>

  <li>ENG. JUDGMENT (engineering judgment)- where no specific
factor may be available for their operation or process and their
judgment is used to select the best fit factor from the choices
available,
  </li>

  <li>MAT. BALANCE (material balance)- where a simple chemical
formula is
used to guesstimate emissions, or
  </li>

  <li>STACK TEST -will provide the best
available data for their operation and is the most preferable method to
use since it provides the most site specific data.</li>

</ul>

<p>For &#8220;factor&#8221; methods you the following additional options are
available:</p>

<ul>

  <li>MFR. SPEC
(manufacturer&#8217;s specifications)- which provide best available data
regarding control equipment efficiency regarding capture and
destruction,
  </li>

  <li>OEPA- may have data collected from other similar facilities
/sources
that the facility may use if they lack their own specific factors.
These may be Fire based or calculated from testing,
  </li>

  <li>SITE-SPECIFIC- either gathered from stack testing, material
balance, or some other way
of figuring out their own specific data,
  </li>

  <li>TRADE GROUP- associations may provide useful data based on
other members in the group who have
similar operations to the facility and have already figured out the
emissions factor which may be shared with them, or
  </li>

  <li>VENDOR-a product vendor will supply an MSDS sheet which may
contain helpful information
regarding a specific factor to use or a method to calculate their own
factor based on usage of their product.</li>

</ul>

<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
<a name="factor"></a></p>

<h6>Factor Methods</h6>

<p>When choosing a &#8220;factor&#8221; method, <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Hours Uncontrolled</font>
and <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Uncontrolled
Emissions Factor</font> columns are entered. The system
automatically
calculates the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Emissions
Reported</font> columns based on these entries.</p>

<ul>

  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Hours
Uncontrolled</font>: The hours during the year in which the
emissions
unit was operating but the control equipment was not.
  </li>

  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Uncontrolled
Emissions Factor</font>: The appropriate factor in <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">LBS/X</font>,
where
X=the units as identified in the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Throughput Information</font>
datagrid.
    <p>Clicking on the hyperlinked units in the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Units</font>
column will generate a
pop-up, as depicted in the top of the picture below, which provides
additional information regarding the emissions calculation. Note that
the calculations pop-up shows how 1000 units of uncontrolled emissions
are controlled. Using a multiplier of 1000 allows for better
readability of the values (removing the need to display very small
numbers).</p>

    <div align="center">
    <p><img alt="Calculations Pop-up" src="images/calculations_popup.jpg" title="Calculations Pop-up" style="border: 1px solid ;" vspace="4"></p>

    </div>

    <p>Useful information about the calculations:</p>

  </li>

  <li>Emissions not captured by a piece of control equipment
(using capture
efficiency) are fugitive emissions.
  </li>

  <li>Emissions captured but not
controlled (using operating control efficiency) are output from the
control equipment for further consideration.
  </li>

  <li>Control efficiency is
reduced by <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Hours
Uncontrolled/Hours per Year</font>.
  </li>

  <li>Emissions entering a
fugitive release point are fugitive emissions and emissions entering a
stack release point are stack emissions.
  </li>

  <li>If the output of one piece of
control equipment enters two or more other units (control equipment or
release points) then the emissions are divided evenly into each.
  </li>

  <li>If
the control equipment does not specify control for a VOC-HAP (PM-HAP),
then the system uses the control for VOC (PM-Filterable), if present.</li>

</ul>

<p>If no capture efficiency for the pollutant is specified for
the control
equipment, the system still uses the lowest capture efficiency of other
pollutants for this pollutant. For example, SO2 in the example below:</p>

<div align="center">
<p><img alt="Calculated Emissions Pop-up" src="images/calcEmissions_popup.jpg" title="Calculated Emissions Pop-up" style="border: 1px solid ;" vspace="4"></p>

<a name="oepa_method"></a></p>

<u><i><h7>Important Information About the factor:OEPA
Method</h7></i></u>
<p>When this method is selected, only the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Hours Uncontrolled
column</font> is
entered by the facility.</p>

<p>The system calculated value will be in the
<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Factor (LBS/X)</font>column.
Clicking on the hyperlinked <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">factor:OEPA</font>
in the
<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Method Used</font>
column will generate a <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Choice
of FIRE factors</font> pop-up, as
depicted below, which provides information regarding the emissions
factor and how the calculation was performed. Please note that we use
the term FIRE factors and Internal Emissions Factors database
interchangeably. Either one of those two terms mean the same database
since the Internal Emissions Factors is compiled from FIRE, identified
and appended missing FIRE emissions factors and converted FIRE factors
into a streamlined set of factors with consistent units for each SCC.</p>

<div align="center">
<p><img alt="Choice of FIRE Factors Datagrid" src="images/fireChoice_datagrid.jpg" title="Choice of FIRE Factors Datagrid" style="border: 1px solid ;" vspace="4"></p>

</div>

<p>In some cases the system may not have initially calculated a
value for
this method. This information is being supplied in this Help page to
help Ohio EPA staff further understand the choices made by the facility
during entry of their emissions inventories. The facility may have also
encountered the following during the process:</p>

<ul>

  <li>A message in the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Factor (LBS/X)</font>
column = <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">pending
FIRE row</font>. When they
saw the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">pending
FIRE row </font>message it was because either:
    <ul>

      <li>There is no emissions factor in FIRE for that process.
If there is no
emissions factor in FIRE, when they clicked on the hyperlinked <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">pending
FIRE row</font> message in the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Factor (LBS/X)</font>
column, they would have seen the
following message in a <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Choice
of Fire Factors</font> pop-up under the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Fire ID</font>
column: <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">No
applicable FIRE Factors</font>. If this occurs, they were
required
to select a different method or to contact Ohio EPA&#8217;s EIS Section for
assistance in incorporating a specific emissions factor.
      </li>

      <li>In rare cases, about 2%, they may have more than one
choice for an emissions
factor. If there is more than one choice for an emissions factor, when
they would have clicked on the hyperlinked <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">pending FIRE row</font>
message in
the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Factor
(LBS/X)</font> column, they would have seen the choices in the
        <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Choice
of Fire Factors</font> pop-up and they would have chosen which
one they
wish to be used for calculation purposes.</li>

    </ul>

  </li>

  <li>A message in the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Factor
(LBS/X)</font> column = <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">pending formula</font>.
If they encountered the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">pending
formula</font> message it is because one or more variables in the
calculation
formula needed to be identified by the facility. When this occurs you
will see a new datagrid in the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Material Information,
Annual Average
Operating Schedule &amp; Throughput Percent</font> section
with the
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Variable</font>
identified and the value they entered. They would have clicked
on the hyperlinked <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">pending
formula</font> message in the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Factor (LBS/X)</font>
column
and seen the emissions factor formula, under the heading <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Formula</font>,
in
the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Choice
of Fire Factors</font> pop-up. They would have reviewed the
formula
for the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Variable</font>
identified as pending and decided on the appropriate
value. Often, the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Notes</font>
field gave greater detail.
    <p>The following
variables will require additional information as described above:</p>

    <blockquote>
HCl = Heat content for liquids (mmbtu/gallon)<br>

HCg = Heat content for gases (mmbtu/scf)<br>

HCs = Heat content for solids (mmbtu/lb)<br>

A = Ash content<br>

S = Sulfur Content<br>

Ca/S = Calcium Content / Sulfur Content ratio<br>

CL = Chlorine content<br>

C = Carbon content
    </blockquote>

  </li>

</ul>

<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a>

<h6>Emissions Methods</h6>

<p>When an &#8220;emissions&#8221; method was selected, the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Emissions
Reported
Fugitive Amount</font> and <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Stack Amount</font>
columns were entered by the facility.
The <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Units</font>
column will default to <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">TONS</font>
but they were given the option to
change it to <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Lbs</font>.
The system automatically calculates the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Emissions
Reported Total</font> column.</p>

<ul>

  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Fugitive
Amount</font>: The amount of annual fugitive
emissions they are reporting.
  </li>

  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Stack
Amount</font>: The amount of annual stack emissions they are
reporting.</li>

</ul>

<p>If they select an &#8220;emissions&#8221; method, they were instructed to
attach a
spreadsheet showing what was used to calculate the emissions. This
attachment may be under the Attachments section as discussed above or
could also be in the <a href="#explain">"Explanation"</a>
section discussed below.</p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
<a name="explain"></a></p>

<h5>Explanation</h5>

<p>This column may contain any explanation/justification the
facility
added for their calculations. If this is the case you will see a
checkmark in the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Explanation</font>
column for that pollutant. You can view
the explanation/justification by clicking the why hyperlink. If the
facility selected an &#8220;emissions&#8221; method, they needed to attach a
spreadsheet showing what was used to calculate the emissions.</p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
<a name="secret"></a></p>

<h5>Trade Secrecy</h5>

<p>If the facility determined that variables, explanations OR
emissions
factor information reported (for any pollutant in the datagrid for
which the &#8220;factor&#8221; method was used), is a trade secret, you will be
able to click on the why hyperlink (in red) to view the justification;

<h5>Important Information About Emissions Inventories Submitted for
2008 and Later Years</h5>

<p>Starting with the 2008 reporting year, the EIS portion of the
inventory
will include all the FER/criteria pollutants in the process level and
only those HAPs which the FIRE database describes as belonging to the
process (same SCC and material). The facility is required to pick the
best method to calculate the emissions for the FER/criteria pollutants.
Stack tested emission factors are considered the most reliable emission
factors and they were expected to report them. The default emissions
factors should be their last selection. However, for HAP pollutants,
the inventory will automatically pick the default factors from the FIRE
database to calculate emissions. The facility was guided to review the
estimate for each HAP pollutant and make any necessary revisions. As a
convenience, the Hours Uncontrolled defaults to &#8220;0&#8221;. No additional
action was required unless there is more than one FIRE row for that
pollutant or a variable that requires a value, as discussed above. If
the process does not actually generate that emission or generates a
different amount, the facility was guided to change the method used and
the appropriate information related to that process.</p>

<h3>Reviewing a Title V or Synthetic Minor Title V Emissions
Inventory</h3>

<p>DO/LAA review of an emissions inventory is applicable to the FER
and any
ES information. The buttons and discussion below will only complete the
review process for FER and ES reporting. EIS approval is handled
separately and discussed under the next heading.</p>

<p>The following buttons are available for the review process:</p>

<div align="center">
<p><img alt="Review Process Buttons" src="images/review_buttons.jpg" title="Review Process Buttons" style="border: 0px solid ;" ;="" vspace="4"></p>

</div>

<p>If <img alt="Revision Requested Button" src="images/btn_revReq.jpg" height="20" width="131">&nbsp;or
<img alt="Approve/Revision Requested Button" src="images/btn_approveRevReq.jpg" height="20" width="185">&nbsp;is selected, this does not alter the
workflow or notify
the
facility. The DO/LAA staff will need to follow up with the facility.</p>

<p>The first time an inventory enters an approved state, an invoice
object may
be created. However, this cannot occur until the DO/LAA staff person
completes the appropriate workflow.</p>

<p>If <img alt="Inventory Prior/Invalid Button" src="images/btn_rptNotNeeded.jpg" height="20" width="132">&nbsp;is
selected, you will not be able to approve the inventory
later.</p>

<p>If you are reviewing a revised emissions inventory and the previously
submitted
inventory for which the revision was submitted has not been reviewed yet,
it may be necessary for you to review the previously submitted inventory
before you can proceed with the revised emissions inventory. This will be indicated
in the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Information</font>
bar at the top of the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Emissions
Inventory Detail</font> page
when you try to approve the revised emissions inventory.</p>

<p>As a tool for the review process you also have the ability to
compare
inventories for the same facility. Click <img alt="Compare Inventories Button" src="images/btn_compareRpts.jpg" height="20" width="101">, generating up a pop-up,
seen
below, to select the comparison report. You can enter a percentage
value (defaulting to 20%) you wish the comparison to be made against in
the text box. Then select the Inventory ID hyperlink for the specific
inventory you wish to compare to the inventory your viewing.</p>

<div align="center">
<p><img alt="Compare Inventories Datagrid" src="images/compareRpts_datagrid.jpg" title="Compare Inventories Datagrid" style="border: 1px solid ;" vspace="4"></p>

</div>

<p>If values in the current inventory differ more than a specified
percent
from the comparison inventory; then the value in the current inventory is
flagged.</p>

<p>Differences in compared values for fugitive emissions, stack
emissions
or total emissions also flags the pollutant name. Factor values and
method used are also compared. Note that if the original inventory is
missing a value while the comparison inventory is not, the word &#8220;null&#8221; is
used in order to have a value to highlight.</p>

<p>The example below identifies a comparison for a single process
in an
emissions inventory.</p>

<div align="center">
<p><img alt="Single Process Comparison Datagrid" src="images/compareRpts_single_datagrid.jpg" title="Single Process Comparison Datagrid" style="border: 1px solid ;" vspace="4"></p>

</div>

<p>Any red text indicates trade secret information and
would only be viewable if you have been granted right to view the trade
secret data. If you have not been granted trade secret access you would
see <font color="red">&#8220;XXXX&#8221;</font> instead of the
trade secrete value/information. In the
comparison inventory each row of data is duplicated with the top row
indicating values/information for the inventory you were viewing and the
row below it indicating values/information for the inventory you selected
to compare against. If the values/information exceed the comparison
percentage the information/value will be in bold font.</p>

<div align="center">
<p><img alt="Single Process Comparison Datagrid - Trade Secret Example" src="images/compareRpts_singleTS_datagrid.jpg" title="Single Process Comparison Datagrid - Trade Secret Example" style="border: 1px solid ;" vspace="4"></p>

</div>

<p>If you are viewing a revised emissions inventory you can alternatively
click&nbsp;<img alt="Compare with Previous Button" src="images/btn_compareWPrev.jpg" height="20" width="151">
to
compare the revised emissions inventory with the inventory that this is a revision of.
The percent difference used will be 20% unless the user changed it
since last logging into the system. Note that if more than one revised
inventory for a given year exists, the previous inventory is the most recent
previously created inventory for that year.</p>

<h4>EIS Review</h4>

<p>If an EIS was submitted as part of the emissions inventory you
will see
the following button: <img alt="EIS Approve Button" src="images/btn_eisApprove.jpg" height="20" width="88">.
EIS approval will occur by Central Office
staff; therefore, it will not be necessary for DO/LAA staff to use this
button.</p>

    <p>You will also notice the ability to report emissions under
the
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Emissions
Information</font> section for one or both years may be adjusted
based on any change indicated above. For example, if emissions are
being reported for 2006 and 2007 and they indicated they purchased the
facility in mid 2007, they would not be responsible for reporting and
paying fees for 2006 UNLESS they checked the box indicating they would
report and pay for all emissions for the reporting period.</p>

  </li>

  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Check
here if all contaminant sources have been permanently
shut down
or dismantled</font>: A checkmark in this box indicates <u>ALL</u>
emissions units
(air contaminant sources) at the facility are permanently shut down.
    <p>If selected, to the right they were required to enter a
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Shutdown
Date</font>.</p>

    <p>You will also notice the ability to report emissions under
the
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Emissions
Information</font> section for one or both years will be adjusted
based on the date identifying a permanent shutdown. For example, if
emissions are being reported for 2006 and 2007 and they indicated they
permanently shutdown all air contaminant sources in mid 2007, they
would not be responsible for reporting and paying fees for 2007.</p>

<h3>Owner Information</h3>

<p>This section indicates the
current owner of record with Ohio EPA. If ownership or operational
status has changed they would have identified the change in the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Owner
and/or Shutdown Changes</font> section above. If this is the
case, the
following boxes may appear where they would have entered additional
information.</p>

<ul>

  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Previous
Owner Forwarding Address</font>: Name and address of the
previous
owner.
  </li>

  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">New
Owner Information</font>: Name and address of the new owner.</li>

</ul>

<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
<a name="bill"></a></p>

<h3>Billing &amp; Primary Contact Information</h3>

<p>If billing or primary contact information has changed they
would have
identified the change via the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">My Updated Billing
Contact Information</font>
and <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">My
Updated Primary Contact Information</font> headings. If the
appropriate
person is not available in the picklist you will click&nbsp;<img alt="Edit Button" src="images/btn_edit.jpg" height="20" width="40"> to enter the new
contact information into the pop-up (* represents required fields).</p>

<p>Depending on selections made, important messages may be
generated by
the system and will be identified in blue text. For example, when
identifying <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Previous
Owner Forwarding Address</font>, under the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Current
Primary Contact Information of Record</font> box the following
message will be
displayed: <font color="#3333ff" face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Previous Owner
forwarding address will end the current
Primary contact</font>. You will then know to look for the
reporting of a new
primary contact.</p>

<h3>Emissions Information</h3>

<ul>

  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Emissions
reported in previous years</font>: This field will
identify their
emissions as reported previously. It is for informational purposes.
  </li>

  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Indicate
the total for all the pollutants facility-wide for
the
year(s) specified by selecting the appropriate range for each year</font>:
Identifies the emissions they are reporting and paying fees for.
    <p>If they selected <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">50 or more but less
than 100; enumerate</font>
OR <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">More than
100;
enumerate</font> an <u>Additional Emissions Information
section will also be
completed</u></p>

    <p>If total emissions of all pollutants are 50 or more TPY,
they would
have entered a <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">TPY</font>
value for each pollutant. If a pollutant is not
applicable, they enter &#8220;0&#8221;. The system will not check their math so it
should be confirmed the totals match the reported range.</p>

  </li>

</ul>

<h3>Emissions Statement</h3>

<p>An ES should be submitted with the FER if the facility resides
in a
non-attainment county and the facility emits greater than 25 tons per
year of NOx AND/OR VOC. If the facility resides in a non-attainment
county for either NOx or VOC the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">NonAttainment County</font>
checkbox would
have been automatically checked but they could uncheck the box if their
emissions for both pollutants are less than or equal to 25 tons per
year, disabling the reporting requirement.</p>

<ul>

  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">These
Emissions must be reported if Facility is in a
non-attainment county and any one of these
pollutant emissions is more than 25 Tons Per Year (TPY)</font>:
If they
reported under the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Additional
Emissions Information</font> section above any
values for NOx over 25 tons, it will be automatically populated in this
table. Otherwise, they would have entered the appropriate values for
NOx and VOC emissions in TPY.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Attachments</h3>

<p><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Attachments</font>: This section is where they attach any necessary
documents
to the emissions inventory. The <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Attachment Type</font> (public) and <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Trade Secret
Document</font> (trade) columns of the datagrid are hyperlinks that allow you
to view the document once uploaded. You will be able to click on the

<h3>Reviewing a Non-Title V Emissions Inventory</h3>

<p>The following buttons are available for the review process:</p>

<div align="center">
<p><img alt="Review Process Buttons" src="images/review_buttons.jpg" title="Review Process Buttons" style="border: 0px solid ;" ;="" vspace="4"></p>

</div>

<p>If&nbsp;<img alt="Revision Requested Button" src="images/btn_revReq.jpg" height="20" width="131"> or&nbsp;<img alt="Approve/Revision Requested Button" src="images/btn_approveRevReq.jpg" height="20" width="185"> is selected, this does not alter the workflow or notify
the
facility. The DO/LAA staff will need to follow up with the facility.</p>

<p>The first time an inventory enters an approved state, an invoice
object may
be created. However, this cannot occur until the DO/LAA staff person
completes the appropriate workflow.</p>

<p>If <img alt="Inventory Prior/Invalid Button" src="images/btn_rptNotNeeded.jpg" height="20" width="132">&nbsp;is selected, you will not be able to approve the inventory
later.</p>

<p>If you are reviewing a revised emissions inventory and the previously
submitted
inventory for which the revision was submitted has not been reviewed yet,
it may be necessary for you to review the previously submitted inventory
before you can proceed with the revised emissions inventory. This will be indicated
in the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Information</font> bar at the top of the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Emissions Inventory Detail</font> page
when you try to approve the revised emissions inventory.</p>

<h4>Exception-&#8220;Trivial&#8221; Non-Title V Emissions Inventories</h4>

<p>Some &#8220;trivial&#8221; Non-Title V emissions inventories may be accepted by the
system automatically upon submission proceeding straight to the
invoicing step of the workflow (not requiring DO/LAA review). In order
for an inventory to fit this category, it must:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Be reporting emissions for both years at levels that do not require
enumerating (less than 50 TPY),
  </li>
  <li>There can be no changes to ownership, contacts, permanent shutdown,
etc.
  </li>
  <li>The selected emissions reporting range for both years must be the
same range specified in the last year of the previous two-year inventory.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
<a name="auto"></a></p>

<h3>Automatic Updating of the Facility Detail Upon Acceptance</h3>

<p>Some information identified in the emissions inventory will be
automatically updated in their <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility Detail</font> <u>after Ohio EPA has
reviewed and accepted the inventory. The following information is
automatically updated</u>:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Facility name change
  </li>
  <li>Transfer of ownership (to single owner)
  </li>
  <li>Billing contact change
  </li>
  <li>Primary contact change
  </li>
  <li>Previous owner forwarding (previous primary), and
  </li>
  <li>Facility permanent shutdown dates</li>
</ul>

<p>This includes identifying the appropriate address and contact
information along with any <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Start Date</font> and <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">End Date</font> information for the
various contacts in the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Owner/Contact</font> third-level menu of the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility
Profile</font>.</p>

<p>For permanent shutdown of all emissions units, approval of the inventory
sets the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility Detail</font> states to <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permanently Shutdown</font>, for the
facility, and sets the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Shutdown Date</font> and the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Shutdown Notification Date</font>
(for the emissions units).</p>

<div align="center">

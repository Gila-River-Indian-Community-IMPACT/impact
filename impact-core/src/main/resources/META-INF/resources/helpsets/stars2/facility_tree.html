<h1>Facility Tree</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The &#8220;Facility Tree&#8221; concept is graphical, interactive, and
available on almost all screens within the system. The tree enables you
to navigate within the virtual/online facility by simply clicking on
the tree icons which are labeled and graphically represent individual
or collective emissions units, processes, control equipment, and release
points.</p>
<p>The Facility Tree contains and displays the relationship
between emissions units, process, control equipment and release point
information; e.g., whether control equipment is in series or parallel
and whether release points are venting controlled or uncontrolled
emissions.</p>
<p>The icons appearance also gives a clear indication of the
emissions unit operational status as well as being hyperlinked to all
information known about that particular item. </p>
<p>Below is an example of a Facility Tree. While in the system,
clicking on any item that appears brown and is underlined will display
the specific information available at that level.</p>
<div align="left">
<p><img alt="Facility Tree" src="images/app_tree_description.jpg" title="Facility Tree" style="border: 0px solid ;" vspace="4"></p>
</div>
<p>Note that release point EP01 is associated with the Shredder
Baghouse in
both emissions units F001 and F002. This scenario is common for control
equipment. The graphical nature of the tree allows you to easily see
which controls have been associated with each emissions unit within the
facility.</p>
<p>As shown &#8220;graphically&#8221; and as mentioned earlier in the
example, an
emissions unit (F002) can have one or more &#8220;process&#8221; associated. Each
process is characterized by one SCC number as supplied by the facility.
The SCC number is entered or selected via a built-in search tool within
the system and can be searched by either a cascading level menu or a
keyword. All types of facilities (e.g., Title V, non-Title V, Synthetic
Minor) will need to identify SCC codes in the new system, regardless of
whether it was necessary in the past.</p>
<p>In summary, an emissions unit will have one or more processes
associated with it. A process may have one or more control equipment,
release points or both associated with it. Egress points may be
associated to a process (e.g. fugitive) or a control equipment (e.g.
stack). A control equipment may have one or more release points,
subsequent control equipment, or both associated with it. The Facility
Tree is designed to capture any real world scenario.</p>

<h2>Create Emissions Unit</h2>
<p>The system&#8217;s
<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility
Profile</font> page allows you to create an emissions unit from
the
<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Create
Emissions Unit</font> button located at the bottom of the page.
This is
where you add an emission unit that is not listed in the Facility Tree.</p>
<p>Asterisks(*) denote what the system requires for creating an
emission
unit. However, information in some other data fields may be needed for
the system to perform other functions. Therefore, completing as many
fields as possible with correct information benefits the system and all
its users.</p>
<p>To begin the process, click on the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Create Emissions Unit</font>
button and
complete the fields discussed below.</p>
<ul>

<h3>Entering Emissions Unit Information</h3>
<ul>
<li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">AQD
Emissions Unit
ID.</font> - This is the ID that will be included in permits and
on
documentation within the system. The assigned ID should not duplicate
another ID in the current <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility Detail</font>
tree. For example, if the
facility is adding a fourth boiler, and the last boiler installed was
B003 then you can give the new boiler an ID of B004.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">AQD
Description</font> - Not required in the system but is beneficial
to
differentiate between similar emissions units at the facility. This
description will be used in permits and on documentation within the

new boiler may be described as: 116 Megawatt Coal Fired Boiler with
electrostatic precipitator and scrubber.<br>

<a name="allow_emit"></a></p>
<h3>Allowable Emissions</h3>
<p><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Allowable
Emissions</font> can be added to the newly created
emissions unit
whereas existing emissions unit(s) should already have a permit with
allowables.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Only complete the table for
qualifying emission units
as requested by the Ohio EPA&#8217;s SIP or Modeling section. Please refer to
document &#8220;Allowable Emissions Instructions and Understandings&#8221; in the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">External
Reference</font> section of the system for further insight.</p>
<p>To add the emissions unit&#8217;s permitted allowables, you click
on the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Add
Emissions</font> button at the bottom of the list. Select the
pollutant from
the pick list and add the allowable, if applicable, in <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Pounds/hour</font>
and/or <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Tons/Year</font>.
Comments may be added to each pollutant if necessary.
For example, if a unit has been issued more than one PTI, you can add
the PTI number in which the allowable emissions originate from. To
enter more than one allowable, click the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Add Emissions</font>
button again and
repeat the previous steps. To delete pollutants from the list, click
the toggle button under the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Select</font>
column and click the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Delete
Selected
Pollutants</font> button.</p>
<p>You can print the allowable emissions list by
clicking the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Printable
view</font> button and then clicking print in the
pop-up. You can also export the data by clicking the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Export to Excel</font>
button.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Facility total allowable emissions
can be viewed by
clicking the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Allowable
Emissions</font> in the third-level menu on the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility
Profile</font> page. The total will only be a total of
emissions that have been individually input into each individual
emission unit page. In other words, it is not required to fill out
allowable emissions for each emission unit. (see note above) For
example,
if there are allowables entered for just two emission units out of 12,
then the total for the facility will only be for those two units. </p>
</ul>
<p>Once
you have finished entering the all the information click the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Save</font>
button. The newly created emission unit ID will now be listed in the
Facility Tree with a set of blue gears <img alt="Emissions Unit" src="images/EU.gif" height="24" width="28">.</p>
<p>The system also has the
ability to create a clone of an emissions unit, useful for creating
additional emissions units with similar features, rather than entering
duplicate information repeatedly. Refer to the <a href="#create_cloned_eu">&#8220;Create a Cloned Emissions
Unit&#8221;</a> heading for more information on this feature.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>To continue
creating the emission unit, additional information may need to be
entered. Refer to the following headings below: <a href="#create_ep">&#8220;Create
EmissionsProcess&#8221;</a>, <a href="#create_ce">&#8220;Create

<p><a href="#main_menu">Back to Main Menu</a>
<a name="create_cloned_eu"></a></p>
<h2>Create a Cloned Emissions Unit</h2>
<p>Another system feature is the
ability to create an exact copy of an emission unit. This is useful for
creating additional emissions units with similar features, rather than
entering duplicate information repeatedly. This function is found under
the Facility Tree by clicking on the emissions unit that you wish to
copy. At the bottom of the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Emission Unit
Information</font> page, click on the
<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Create Cloned
Emission Unit</font> button. A screen will populate with the
information from the emission unit being copied. You enter a new <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">AQD
Emissions Unit ID</font> as described in the&nbsp;help above,
as well as, any other information that you deem necessary to
differentiate this unit from the unit copied. Once all information has
been entered click the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Save</font>
button and the emissions unit will appear
in the Facility Tree as previously explained.</p>

<h2>Permanently Shutting Down a Facility or Emissions Unit</h2>
<p>In order to permanently shutdown a facility or an emissions
unit(s),
Ohio EPA must receive a request and signed certification from the
authorized official, as defined in OAC rule 3745-31-04(B) for non-Title
V facilities, or the responsible official, as defined in OAC rule
3745-77-01 for Title V facilities, that identifies the facility ID or
emission unit ID(s) and the date on which the facility or emissions
unit(s) was permanently shutdown. If you select <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permanently Shutdown</font>
from the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Operating
Status</font> picklist, you will be required to enter a
<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Shutdown Date</font>.
The <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Shutdown
Date</font> should be entered according to the
actual shutdown date identified in the letter from the authorized
official/responsible official, which may not necessarily correspond to
the date of the letter itself.</p>
<p>The steps for permanently shutting down
a facility are discussed in the Help page for <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility Detail</font>.</p>
<p><a href="#main_menu">Back to Main Menu</a>
<a name="create_ep"></a></p>
<h2>Create Emissions Process</h2>
<p>The system allows you to create an
emissions process for a specific emissions unit where you can identify
the emissions unit process description, name, and Source Classification
Code (SCC). An emissions process with a valid SCC associated to its
corresponding emissions unit is required by the system in order for
applications to be effectively submitted and subsequently be issued a
permit. This feature is accessed either by clicking on the specific
emissions unit icon,&nbsp;<img alt="Emissions Unit" src="images/EU.gif" height="24" width="28"> ,

may also associate a &#8220;subsequent&#8221; control equipment with a specific
control equipment. There may be more than one piece of control
equipment associated with an emissions process, and there may be more
than one emissions process in the facility that uses any particular
piece of control equipment. However, any subsequent control equipment
associated with a specific control equipment cannot be associated to
another emissions process without the initial control equipment be
associated first. Subsequent control equipment will always follow the
initial control equipment, during association and disassociation. If a
single piece of control equipment is used more than once in the
Facility Tree, which is often the case, it will appear in the tree as
many times as it is used. Also, the specific control equipment icon
will be highlighted if selected throughout the Facility Tree.</p>

point you wish to add to the Facility Tree. Once you have chosen the
type, you fill in all input fields with the information relating to
that release point. Note: whatever is entered for the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Company ID</font>
is what
will be used in the Facility Tree as the release point ID. The <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">EIS</font>
section, when expanded, allows you to enter the information not already
populated for you.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>For release points that have continuous emissions
monitor system(s) (CEMS), the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">CEM Data</font>
section should be completed. To
add a CEMS, click the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Add
CEM</font> button and enter the monitor brand and
model into the input field. For example: Siemens Ultramat 6. Then click
the box under the appropriate pollutant(s) in which it measures in the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Pollutant
Monitored</font> column, placing a checkmark in the box(es). To
delete a CEMS, place a checkmark in the box in the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Select</font>
column to the
left of the CEMS you wish to delete and click the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Delete Selected CEMs</font>
button. To add additional CEMS click the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Add CEM</font>
button again and
follow previous steps. Once the CEMS information has been entered,
click <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Save</font>.
Once saved, the CEMS list may be printed by clicking the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Printable
View</font> button or sent to Excel by clicking the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Export to Excel</font>
button.<br>

</li>
<li>Note: If you click <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Cancel</font>
the system will refresh to the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility
Profile</font> page then you must click the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Create Release Point</font>
button again and reenter all information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have clicked <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Save</font>,
the release point will appear at the very bottom of the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility Tree</font>
under&nbsp;<img alt="Disassociated EG Points" src="images/disassociated_eg_pts_flat.jpg" height="26" width="247"> denoted by <img alt="Release Point Icon" src="images/icon_egress_point.bmp" height="16" width="18">.

<h3>Associate Release Points</h3>
<p>An release point can be either
associated with an emissions process, control equipment, or be
completely disassociated from anything else in the facility. Because an
release point may be associated with either a process or a piece of
control equipment or both, it is very important to determine how you
should associate the release point. There may be more than one release
point associated with an emissions process or control equipment, and
there may be more than one emissions process or control equipment in
the facility that uses any particular release point. If a single release
point is used more than once in the Facility Tree, which is often the
case, it will appear in the tree as many times as it is used. Also, the
specific release point icon will be highlighted if selected throughout
the Facility Tree.</p>
<p>If the release point is completely disassociated from
anything else in
the facility, but it still exists in some capacity it will show up in
the Facility Tree as <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Disassociated
release Point</font>. This designation does
not change the release point information that has been entered into the
release point file.</p>
<p><b>Step1: Emissions Process or Control Equipment.</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Click on either the emission process single light blue
gear&nbsp;<img alt="Emissions Process Icon" src="images/icon_emissions_process.bmp" height="16" width="16"> in the
Facility Tree or the wavy blue lines&nbsp;<img alt="Control Equipment Icon" src="images/Icon_control_equip.bmp" height="20" width="20"> of the control equipment that
you
want to associate the release point with. </li>
<li>Scroll to the bottom of the page (either the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Control Equipment

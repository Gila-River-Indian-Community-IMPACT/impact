<h1>System Role-Based Security</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>When you are provided access to the system as a user, you not
only
receive a login name and password, you are granted one or more specific
<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">User Roles</font>
. Each role has a defined set of rights, allowing those
users to perform a specific set of functions. If you do not have rights
to perform a specific function, you will either not be able to see the
function or the function will be displayed but unavailable for you to
select. For instance, Administrators can modify pick-lists throughout
the system in the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Admin</font>
tab which is not visible to other users.</p>

<p>There are user groups associated with general permitting
duties, permit
issuance, trade secret access and supervisory duties, among others.
Should you need increased access to specific system functions, such as
having the ability to view and print Trade Secret documents, contact a
system Administrator.</p>

<h2>Assigning User Roles</h2>


<p>Each facility has 16 specific <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility Roles</font>,
which are viewable via the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">User Roles</font> third-level menu in a <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility
Profile</font>. Staff have been assigned these roles based upon input from
each office. The assignment of <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility Roles</font> is editable by a
supervisor or any other person with the appropriate <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">System Role</font>. For example, every facility is assigned a DO/LAA Permit Writer
to
perform the preliminary and technical review of their permits and
reports; a DO/LAA Reviewer/Approver to sign off on those permits at the
DO/LAA; and a CO Issuance Coordinator to issue permits. See
the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">User Roles</font> help page for information on this feature.</p>

<p>When a workflow
is initiated (ex.permit application submitted), the system&#8217;s workflow
engine builds the workflow and pre-assigns all possible tasks in that
workflow to the specific user who has the associated role for the
facility that is inherently generating the workflow (permit applicant).</p>

<p>Once the user roles are changed in the facility inventory, all
subsequent
workflow tasks will be assigned to the new staff person that has the
role. <b>Workflows that were already established prior to the reassignment
will retain the previously assigned personnel.</b> These previously
assigned personnel can be changed by going to the specific workflow and
reassigning either individual tasks or the entire workflow. Navigate to
the workflow and click Help in the upper right hand corner of the
screen for more details concerning reassignment of the workflow. For
help on this feature, view the help page entitled <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Reassign</font> of the
<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Workflow Diagram</font>.</p>

<p>Also available to a supervisor is the ability to make
wholesale
reassignments via the second-level menu of the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Tools</font> tab (<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility
Operations &gt; Facility Roles</font>).</p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>

<h2>New Facility &#8211; Role assignments</h2>

<p>When a new facility is created in the system, <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility Roles</font>
are
established based on a definition table maintained by the System
Administrator. The assignments are made on a county level. Contact a
System Administrator to have the default assignments modified.</p>

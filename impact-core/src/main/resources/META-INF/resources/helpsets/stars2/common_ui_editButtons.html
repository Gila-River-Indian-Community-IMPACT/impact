<h1>Edit Button Operations<br></h1>
<h2>Overview </h2>
<p>This topic covers the common buttons that you will find on windows  
related to entering or editing data, including: 
 
</p><ul>
<li><a href="#edit">Edit</a></li>
<li><a href="#save">Save, Cancel</a></li>
<li><a href="#create">Create, Apply</a></li>
<li><a href="#add-delete">Add, Delete</a></li>
<li><a href="#validate">Validate</a>
</li>	
</ul>  
You may see additional buttons along with   
these common button on pages where you edit   
data.&nbsp; The additional buttons will be specific to the   
object you are accessing and/or the operation operation you are   
performing.&nbsp; Selecting these buttons may also give you the opportunity  
to communicate information to the system that will effect the operation you are 
performing, and thus may be considered Edit Operations buttons; however, the
help topics pertaining to the specific operations will describe these buttons
and their operations. 

<!-- ********** Edit************ -->
<h2><a name="edit"></a><br>Edit</h2>
<p> 
Whenever you are looking at a page that contains data you are expected (or permitted) 
 to enter or modify, you will see an <img alt="Edit button" src="images/btn_edit.jpg">  
 button at the bottom of the screen.&nbsp; Clicking on this button will show you the page 
 with the fields that you are permitted to enter or modify shown as  
 <a href="common_ui_inputFields.html">input fields</a> of various types.  This gives you 
 opportunity to enter data in the fields that are empty and/or change information that is 
 already stored in the system. &nbsp; 
 <p>You will most often see the <img alt="Edit button" src="images/btn_edit.jpg"> 
 button at the bottom of a <a href="common_ui_detailData.html">Detail Data</a> page. 
 In rare instances, you may see it in a different position on the screen.   
 When you encounter the latter, then 
 clicking the button will give you the oppportunity to enter or modify only the information in 
 the section of the screen where the button appears, while in the former case, you will 
 be able to edit all editable fields on the page.   
 Similarly, a button with a label other 
 than 'Edit' may give you access to 'edit mode' for a a limited set of 
 of information.  The <img src="images/btn_createEUGroup.jpg"
 alt="Create EU Group button">, which allows you to edit the groups of emissions units you
 wish to include in a Title V Permit-to-Operate application, is an example of 
 this kind of button.  Other edit-related buttons such as 
 <img src="images/btn_save.jpg" alt="Save button"> and 
<img src="images/btn_capCancel.jpg" alt="Cancel button">
may also apply to these more limited edit operations.
  
 <p>Data  fields that are not
 modifiable (even in edit mode) may be displayed along with the
 editable fields associated with the edit operation you have selected, 
 but the system will not offer the
 data in an input field that gives you the opportunity to modify the value in the field.  For
 example, when you are working on a Facility Detail Change, you are not permitted to modify 
 the Facility Class or Emissions Reporting Category for your facility; only AQD
 personnel may make changes such as these.<p>
 If you see a page of data that has no <img alt="Edit button" src="images/btn_edit.jpg">  
 button, or which has the button, but it appears in gray, and nothing happens when you 
 click on it, they the data is "read-only".  It is a snapshot of data stored in the 
 IMPACT System database and you are not permitted to modify it.  In some cases
 you may be able to modify that data through one of the In Progress Tasks or New Task
 operations.
 <p>
 </p>

<!-- ********** Save, Cancel ************ -->
<h2><a name="save"></a><br>Save, Cancel</h2>
<p>
When you edit data, you must explicitly let the system know when you have completed the 
operation.  The system provides these buttons, 
<img src="images/btn_save.jpg" alt="Save button"> and 
<img src="images/btn_capCancel.jpg" alt="Cancel button"> 
for you to use to identify
the action you want to take when you are leaving an editing session.  
<p>If you select <img src="images/btn_save.jpg" alt="Save button">,
then the system will make a record of any changes you have made on the page.  At this point,
the changes are saved in your working area.  They will not be written to the Air 
Services System database until you submit what you are working on --- the facility inventory
change, permit application, emissions inventory or compliance report.  THe changes will, however,
be available to you the next time you want to work on the associated task.
</p><p>If you select <img src="images/btn_capCancel.jpg" alt="Cancel button">, then the system 
will ignore any changes you have made.  They will not be stored and will not be there 
if you return to that page in the future. <br></p><p>

<!-- ********** Create, Apply Fields ************ --> 
</p><h2><a name="create"></a><br>Create, Apply<br></h2>
<p>
The system provides a <img src="images/btn_create.jpg" alt="Create button"> button that allows
you to create instances of, for example, a permit application or an emissions inventory, after
indicating certain characteristics about the object you wish to create.  Most often
you will see the <img src="images/btn_create.jpg" alt="Create button"> button in a 
<a href="common_ui_popupWin.html"></a> that appears when you indicate that you wish to
create an object, frequently in connection with a New Task. Once you complete the requested
fields in the pop-up window and select
this button, the instance you have created will appear in a list of either In Progress Tasks
you can work on, or a list of that kind of objects associated with your facility.  
(Occasionally, the button that performs this function may be labeled 'Apply'.)</p>

<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>

<!-- ********** Add, Delete ************ -->
<h2><a name="add-delete"></a><br>Add, Delete</h2>
<p> 
You will most often find the <img src="images/btn_add.jpg" alt="Add button"> and 
<img src="images/btn_delete.jpg" alt="Delete button"> buttons when you are 
editing lists or tables of information.  You can <img src="images/btn_add.jpg" alt="Add button">
entries to a list one-at-a-time.  You may delete them either one-at-a-time or
more-than-one-at-a-time depending upon the specific list or table you are working with.
To accomplish the latter, you will be asked to check the list entries you wish to
delete.  For the former you will be asked to select a radio button 
(see <a href="common_ui_inputFields.jpg">Entering &amp; Editing Data --&gt; Input Fields)</a> or click on a single entry in the list
to indicate what you want to delete.
<p>
In some instances the button label will indicate the what you are adding or deleting from
the list, but as long as it says 'Add' or 'Delete' it will work the same way.
<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a> 
 
<!-- ********** Validate ************ --> 
</p><h2><a name="validate"></a><br>Validate</h2>
<p>You will find a <img src="images/btn_validate.jpg" > button on the window for any object
that may be submitted to the IMPACT System for processing.  This includes Facility objects,
Permit Applications and various permit-related requests and notifications, 
Emissions Inventories and Compliance Reports.  When you select this button, the system
checks various information you have entered into the system to be sure that it is consistent,
and complete enough to support the submission you wish to make.  The validation most often 
accesses information you may have entered on different screens and/or at different points
in the process of creating the submission.  The system will not permit you to submit
anuthing that has not been validated.  Therefore, when you select any 
<img src="images/btn_submit.jpg" alt="Submit button"> button, the system will automatically
perform the appropriate validation, even if you do not explicitly request it by
clicking on the <img src="images/btn_validate.jpg" > button associated with the object
you want to submit.  An Information message at the top right of the screen lets you know
if the validation succeeds, as illustrated below for a permit application.
<div align="center">
<img src="images/pbr_validation.jpg" alt="Application/Request Validation Info Message">
</div>
<p>See <a href="common_ui_exceptions.html">Exceptions</a> for a discussion
of exception handling for this complex form validation as well as other types of data
validation that the system performs.

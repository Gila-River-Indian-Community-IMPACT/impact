<h1>System Glossary</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This glossary presents definitions and explanations of terms
that you may encounter in the system.&nbsp; It covers acronyms and
abbreviations as well as full terms for which such information adds to
the usability of the system.<br>

<p>At AQD's discretion, this glossary may be segregated by
'first letter' or by overarching topic or all the terms
may be combined in whatever order they are specified.</p>

<h2>Glossary Terms</h2>
<dl>
<dt><a name="banner">Banner</a></dt>
<dd>The top section of every screen in the IMPACT system.
This section always contains the
Ohio EPA logo, a brief welcome message identifying the person who is
logged in to that screen,
and three common hyperlinks that are available on every screen to make
it easy for you to get to
locations within the website that you may commonly wish to visit.
</dd>
<dt><a name="AQD">AQD</a></dt>
<dd>Division of Air Pollution Control.
<br>
The division of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency that manages
applications for, produces and issues permits with respect to emissions
and also monitors compliance on the basis of reports submitted by <font color="#ff0000">RCU</font>s on behalf of their
facilities. </dd>
<dt><a name="datagrid">Datagrid</a></dt>
<dd>The name used in this system for a table of data, often the
result of a search
you execute from a search window. These tables have special
cabailities, such as
<a class="glossary-link" href="#paging">paging</a>,
<a class="glossary-link" href="#sorting">sorting</a>,
and also provide access to
operations that create a printable view of the data or export
the data to Excel. </dd>
<dt><a name="DOLAA">DO/LAA</a></dt>
<dd>District Office/Local Area Agency. <br>
The offices from which personnel provide air services to <a class="glossary-link" href="#RCU">RCU</a>s.
These offices may be organizationally housed within the Ohio EPA (DOs)
or may be independent of the agency (LAAs). Each DO/LAA is responsible
for RCUs located in their specified region; in total, the DO/LAAs
"cover" the entire state. </dd>
<dt><a name="facilityID">Facility ID<br>

definition of a Facility ID.</font>

-->
<dt><a name="first-level_menu">First-level menu</a></dt>
<dd>This term refers to the set of tabs that appear across the
top of each content or operational screen in the system. They give you
access to the various sub-system functionality that
the system provides. (These are not the same tabs that appear on the <font face="Courier New">Help</font> topic pages.)<br>
</dd>
<dt><a name="hyperlinks">Hyperlinks</a></dt>
<dd>Hyperlinks are items on a screen that, when clicked, take
you to another, presumably related, screen. Hyperlinks normally appear
as underlined words or sets of words, where the words give an
indication of the target or destination to which you are taken when you
select them. The color
and other behavior of hyperlinks depends upon the browser you are using
to access the web pages.<br>
</dd>
<dt><a name="menu"><b>Menu</b></a></dt>
<dd>A well-defined set of values for fields or operations among
which a user may choose. It can be used to refer to
the tabs at the top of each screen, also referred to as a <a class="glossary-link" href="#first-level_menu">first-level
menu</a>, the options offered
just below the tab on each system screen, referred to as a <a class="glossary-link" href="#second-level_menu">second-level
menu</a><a>, the operations, if
any, listed along the left side of each screen, a </a><a class="glossary-link" href="#third-level_menu">third-level
menu</a>, or the choices
available from which to select a value for a field on an input form,
also referred to as a pick-list.
</dd>
<dt><a name="level2-menu">Second-level menu</a></dt>
<dd>This term refers to the set of operation choices that
appear on a line just below the
tabs, or first-level menu items on a screen. These items differ
depending upon which tab
is selected. They give you access to the functionality that
the system provides under each tab.
</dd>
<dt><a name="paging">Paging</a></dt>
<dd>This term describes the capability that the system provides
to control which rows in a <a class="glossary-link" href="#datagrid">
datagrid</a>
you can see on the screen at any point in time. Initially, a table
shows the first set of rows.
If the table doesn't have more rows, then you will not see the paging
controls. However when a table of data is much longer than you can see
on a single screen, the system provides controls you can
use to move among the 'pages' of data in the table. The number of rows
that a datagrid shows on
a single screen
is also the increment by which it pages.<br>

<dt><a name="portable">Portable<br>

<dd><font color="#ff0000">This space for the
definition of Portable.</font>
</dd>
 -->
 <dt><a name="RCU">RCU</a></dt>
<dd>Regulated Community User.<br>
The owners, operators and/or other delegated users of the IMPACT
System who are associated with facilities
that have a relationship with AQD with respect to permits for air
emissions and the enforcement thereof. These users access the system
via the <a href="http://www.epa.state.oh.us">Ohio EPA
e-Business Center</a><font color="#ff0000">&nbsp;</font>
</dd>
<dt><a name="sorting">Sorting</a></dt>
<dd>This term describes the capability that the system provides
to sort the rows in a <a class="glossary-link" href="#datagrid">datagrid</a> in either ascending or
descending order by any column
in the data. Initially, a table appears with a default sort order ---
most often ascending
by the numerical identifier for the objects represented by the data.
However, you can click on any
column header to sort by the data values in that column. The system
indicates the direction of the
sort with an up (for ascending) or down (for descending) arrow in the
column header.
</dd>
<dt><a name="Stars2"><b>Stars2</b></a></dt>
<dd>This system, which supports the Ohio EPA Division of Air
Pollution Control and its Regulated Community Users in managing Air
Pollution Control permits and emissions reporting. The system provides
a web interface for AQD personnel as well as for RCUs (via the Ohio
EPA e-Business Center) to input information and manage the permit
generation and tracking processes. Note that the name of the system
that is used internally within AQD (Stars2) will never appear to the
outside user; they will know the system as "e-Business Gateway - Air
Services".

that follows.) 

* Paste this fragment at the point in the alphabetical listing that you want 
YOUR_TERM to appear: In the paste'd text, make the following replacements: 
<dt><a name="YOUR_TERM_TAG">YOUR TERM</dt> 
<dd>Replace the term_template text with the text you want to specify as the definition of 
YOUR_TERM as illustrated here. </dd> 

TO INCLUDE A GLOSSARY LINK REFERENCE on a web page
* In the appropriate HTML file, immediately preceding the word you want to link, enter
this string, where YOUR_TERM is the glossary term you want to reference.
<a class="glossary-link" href="glossary.html/#YOUR_TERM">YOUR_TERM</a>

Note that the closing </dd> tag is optional. TO REFERENCE YOUR_TERM AS A GLOSSARY TERM IN ON A TOPIC PAGE: * Insert the following string around the term you want to link to the glossary: <a class="glossary_link" href="glossary.html/#YOUR_TERM_TAG" target="_blank">YOUR TERM</a> </dl> <!-- End of glossary list -->

<h1>Input Fields</h1>
<h2>Overview </h2>
<p>
Input fields provide a mechanism for
you to enter data into the system.  You will commonly find input fields
in windows in which
you fill in or update data about your facility, including when you
apply for a permit or submit an emissions or compliance report.  You will
also encounter input fields in <a href="common_ui_popupWin.html">pop-up windows</a> 
that appear
when you invoke particular operations.  
Each instance of an input field type looks the same and works the same way 
throughout 
the system, no matter where it appears.   
This 
topic covers the various input types, illustrating their 
appearance and describing their
operation.  These include simple data input field types, 
such as   
<ul>
<li><a href="#text" target="">Text Fields</a></li>
<li><a href="#picklist" target="">Fields with Pick Lists</a></li>
<li><a href="#date" target="">Date Fields</a></li>
<li><a href="#checkbox">Check Boxes</a></li>
<li><a href="#radio">Radio Buttons</a></li>
</ul> 
as well as more complex mechanisms such as 
<ul>
<li><a href="#inputTable" target="">Entries in Lists</a></li>
<li><a href="#shuttle" target="">Data Shuttles</a></li>
</ul>
The input mechanisms are listed above in approximate order of the frequency with 
which you will encounter them in the system. 
<p>Although clearly related to the process of entering and editing data, 
edit 
operations buttons and data validation</a> are covered in more detail on
other Help topic pages (see 
<a href="#rel_topics">Related Help Topics</a> below).
<!-- In addition, the  
topic covers some special capabilities, such as wildcarding and required fields,  
which apply only to certain types of input fields, as well as input data validation, which the 
system does in several ways, depending on the context. 
-->
<br></p>
<!-- ********** Text Input Fields Section************ --> 
 
<h2><a name="text"></a><br>Text Fields</h2>
Text input fields provide a label identifying the information the 
field contains and a short box into which you type the information you
want to enter into the system.   Text fields may be short, where you
will enter just a word or two, such as when you want to add someone as a
contact for your facility, as shown in <a href="#shortText">Figure 1</a>. 
<p> 
<a name="shortText"></a>
<div align="center">
<img src="images/input_shortText.jpg" alt="Short text input field">
<br><br>
<b>Figure 1: Short Text Input Fields</b>
</div>
</p> 

Or, the field may be longer, and may even provide
scrolling if the information you are entering is likely to be long. You might see the example shown
in <a href="#longText">Figure 2</a> when you enter a Compliance Report, to
provide corrective action in response to a deviation you are reporting.
<p>
<a name="longText"></a>
<div align="center">
<img src="images/input_longText.jpg" alt="Long text input field (w/scrolling)">
<br><br>
<b>Figure 2: Long Text Input Field (with Scrolling)</b>
</div>
</p>
<p>
In either of these cases, you simply place the cursor in the field, type the information you wish to enter
and then select <font face="Courier New">Enter</font> on the keyboard or move to a different
field on the screen. 
</p>
<p> 
Some, but not all, short text input fields, most notably Facility ID and Facility Name in 
Search Criteria windows, support 
the concept of wildcards.  This means that you can use a wildcard character, either '*' or 
'%' to match any number of other characters in that position.  For example, 
if you enter &quot;Univ*&quot; in a Facility Name will match all of the following facility names:  
University of Dayton, University of Toledo, Univar, USA, Universal Metal Products,
etc.  However, if you are looking for Miami University, you should put a
wildcard character at the <u>beginning</u> of the string as well.  If you want to
limit your search to universities, the you would want to use the string *University*
to retrieve them all.  
<p>You may use either wildcard character in any position in
a string and you may use both characters in the same string.  For example,
the string *univ*l* will retrieve all the facilities with the word Universal
anywhere in their name.  It will also, however, retrieve The Ohio State University
at Lima and Kent State University - Fleet Services, among others. Most of the
fields that take wildcards have a 'hint' below the field that shows you examples of
some search strings that use wildcards.

<!-- ********** Pick List section************ -->
<h2><a name="picklist"></a><br>Fields with Pick Lists</h2>
Pick Lists are fields for which you may choose a value from a list
of options that the system presents to you.  
<h3>Standard Pick Lists</h3>
Most pick lists are of
the 'fixed' variety --- you can select exactly one value from the list
to populate the field. If the list has a default value,
then that value will appear in the field, otherwise the field is blank until
you make a selection.  In some cases, for example the
contact <font face="Courier New">Type</font> field shown in 
Figure 3, the choices are pre-defined in the system.
In others, the contents of the drop down list depends on the window
and the field. 
<p>
<a name="picklistDef"></a>
<div align="center">
<img src="images/picklistDef.jpg" alt="Picklist with values from def table">
<br><br>
<b>Figure 3: Pick List Offering Pre-defined Values</b>
</div>
</p>

Figure 4 shows a field for information
you must enter if you are preparing a modification for a submitted 
permit application. 
<p>
<a name="picklistVar"></a>
<div align="center">
<img src="images/picklistVariable.jpg" alt="Variable pick list)">
<br><br>
<b>Figure 4: Pick List Offering Context-sensitive Values</b>
</div>
</p>
In this case, the drop down will contain the identification numbers of 
applications you submitted, but for which you have not 
yet been received a permit. (These are the only applications for which you can submit
this type of modification request.) In either case, though, 
you can see the options available to you by clicking on 
the small blue arrow at the right of the field 
(<img src="images/icon_dropDownArrow.jpg" alt="Drop down arrow">).  This will
bring up the list of available choices.  Select a value 
by clicking
on that entry in the option list. </p> 
<h3>Multi-Select Pick Lists</h3>
In rare instances, a pick list that allows you to pick
more than one value.  For example, the filter offered when you generate
a Workload Report is a multi-select pick list, as illustrated in Figure 5 below.
<a name="multi_picklist"></a>
<p>
<div align="center">
<img src="images/workloadReportFilter.jpg" alt="Multi-select pick list)">
<br><br>
<b>Figure 5: Multi-Select Pick List</b>
</div>
<br>To select all the values between two values in the list, click on the
first value, hold down the Shift key on the keyboard and then move to and
click the last value in the sequence you are interested in.  To select more
than one non-adjacent values from the list, hold down the Ctrl when you click
each selection after the first one.  The values don't actually populate
a separate field as do fixed pick list values but they remain visible in
the list until you modify them, or navigate away from the window.
<br><br><a href="#top">Back to Top</a> 


<!-- ********** Date Fields ************ -->
<h2><a name="date"></a><br>Date Fields</h2>
<p>


Some pages ask you to enter a date.  You may, of course, simply type in the 
date you wish to specify.  
The system accepts nearly all formats for your 
date input:  one or two digits for month and day; two or four digits for 
year; '-' or '/' 
to separate the date components. You cannot, however, mix the separator
characters in the same date string.  For example, 1-6/07 is not a 
valid input for a date field! 
Alternatively, you may select a date from a calendar.  Every date input field
shows a calendar icon (<img src="images/calendar.jpg" alt="calendar icon">)
next to it on the right.  When you click on this icon, it opens to a
calendar that allows you to select a date.  
<p>
<div align="center">&nbsp; 
<img src="images/calendar-open.jpg" alt="move calendar to 
next year">
<br>
<b>Figure 6: Open Calendar from Calendar Icon</b>
<br>
</div>
<p/>
<p>
The calendar initially comes up with today's date highlighted.  You may, however,
navigate within the calendar, using the month and year pick lists or the 
left (<img src="images/icon_movePrevious.jpg" alt="move calendar to 
previous month">)
and right (<img src="images/icon_moveNext.jpg" alt="move calendar to 
next year">) 
arrows next to the pick lists to move either date component backward or
forward.  Once the calendar shows the month you want, then
click on the day-of-the-month to select the date.</p>
<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>

<!-- ********** Check Boxes ************ -->
<h2><a name="checkbox"></a><br>Check Boxes</h2>
<p>
You will see check boxes on input pages when you, for example,
<font face="Courier New">Change Facility Detail</font> or
Create or Edit a <font face="Courier New">PTI/PTIO Application</font>.  
Check boxes display indicators for whether or not your facility is 
<font face="Courier New">Portable</font>, and to indicate which
federal rules apply to your facility. 
<p>
<a name="checkBoxFigure"></a>
<div align="center">
<img src="images/input_checkboxesPortable.jpg" alt="Check box input field">
<br><b>Figure 7: Check boxes for Data Display and Data Entry </b>
</div>
<p> 
The check box field shown in <a href="images/ext_inputFieldCheckBox.jpg"></a>
is essentially a Yes/No or True/False indicator.  If the box is checked, 
as on the right,
then the item is Yes/True; if
it is not checked, as on the left, then the item is No/False.  
When you are entering or modifying data, you can change a check box
simply by clicking in the box.
</p>
<p>
Each check box is independent of any other check boxes that may be
appear to be displayed in a group.  Whether a check box is marked or
does not affect whether any other check box is marked.</p>
<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>

<!-- ********** Radio Buttons ************ -->
<h2><a name="radio"></a><br>Radio Buttons</h2> 
Some data in the Stars2 is represented by one or more 
radio buttons.  Radio buttons are used, for example, 
when you select an application which you would like 
to copy as the base for another application. 
 
Radio buttons allow you to select one of a set or group 
of items or values.  A set of radio buttons may have no 
item selected, or it may have one item selected, but it can never 
have more than one item selected.  Like check boxes, you select a radio 
button by clicking inside the circle.  If you click on another 
radio button in the set, then the first one you picked will 
be un-selected.   
<p>
<a name="radioFigure"></a>
<div align="center">
<img src="images/inputFieldRadioButtons.jpg" alt="Radio button(s) 
portal input field">
<br><b><br>Figure 8: Radio Buttons</b>
</div>
<p> 
The check box field shown in <a href="#radioFigure"></a>
is essentially a Yes/No or True/False indicator.  If the box is checked, 
as on the right,
then the item is Yes/True; if
it is not checked, as on the left, then the item is No/False.  
When you are entering or modifying data, you can change a check box
simply by clicking in the box.
</p>
<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>


<!-- ********** Entries in Lists ************ -->
<h2><a name="inputTable"></a><br>Entries in Lists</h2> 
You will encounter lists in which you wish to enter additional entries, 
or delete entries that the system displays in many location.&nbsp; 
You can see one example in <a href="#checkBoxFigure">Figure 7</a> 
You will also see longer examples of such lists wherever a list of pollutants is
displayed for edit.  <a href="#figure9">Figure 9</a> offers an example of a pollutant
list taken from the Emissions Inventory input page where you will enter the emissions for various
pollutants for the year on which you are reporting.
<p>
<a name="figure9"></a>
<div align="center">
<img src="images/erpt_pollutantInput.jpg" alt="Pollutant List for Edit">
<b><br>Figure 9: Pollutant List for Edit</b>
</div>
<p> 
This figure actually illustrates several user interface concepts.  Check boxes are used here
for several purposes,
including selecting pollutants that you have already added to the table and may now wish to delete,
indicating whether a there are charges associated with each pollutant in the table (you may not edit
this one; it's only there for your information), and any information in your report that
you wish to remain Trade Secret.  The Pollutant, Method, and Unit columns illustrate
pick lists, while the data used to report or compute emissions are text input fields,
where the required text input is numeric.
<p>At the  bottom of the list, you will find the <img src="images/btn_addEmission.jpg"> button 
which gives you the capability to add pollutants to the list of pollutants for which
you are reporting emissions.&nbsp; 
When you select this button, the system opens a new row in the table with a pick list 
of the possible values for
the key field of the row you are adding (in this case, pollutants).  Entering items in a 
list or table is covered in more detail 
in the discussion of <a href="common_ui_editButtons.jpg">Edit Button Operations</a>.
</p>
<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>

<!-- ********** Data Shuttle ************ -->
<h2><a name="shuttle"></a><br>Data Shuttle</h2>
The data shuttle is an element that appears infrequently in the IMPACT system.  
You will use such an element to control which emissions units are included
when you enter the data to apply for an air permit.   
<p>
<a name="figure10"></a>
<div align="center">
<img src="images/input_dataShuttle.jpg" alt="Pollutant List for Edit">
<b><br>Figure 10: Data Shuttle for Adding Emissions Units to a Permit Application</b>
</div>
<p> You may select one or more EUs on either side of the shuttle. (To select 
more than one, hold down the CTRL key while you select the EUs.)  Then, select the 
appropriate button to move the selected EUs in the direction you wish to move them. 
In this example, the user has selected EUs B011, B012 and B013 from among the 
currently-excluded EUs.  Upon clicking on the right arrow (img src="images/right_arrow.jpg") 
between the two sides 
of the shuttle, the system will move these EUs from the Excluded EUs list to
the IncludedEUs list.
Note that, rather than selecting individual EUs, you may Include ALL the EUs in  
a facility that are eligible to be included in the target application.

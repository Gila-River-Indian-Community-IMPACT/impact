<h1>Compliance Report Detail</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This topic covers the second-level menu, <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Compliance Report
Detail</font>,
under the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Compliance
Reports</font> tab. Compliance reports are either
completed by the owner or operator of a facility manually (hard copy)
or electronically. Hard copy submittals are entered electronically by
DO/LAA staff. The same compliance report forms are completed regardless
of whether they are entered by DO/LAA staff from hard copy reports or
submitted electronically through the gateway by a regulated community
user. One exception is that the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">TV Annual Compliance
Certification</font> is
required to be submitted electronically by the external user.</p>

<p>Depending on whether you are viewing a report that has been
submitted or you are
viewing a report that has yet to be submitted &#8220;electronically&#8221; (i.e., a
report in the process of being electronically entered by DO/LAA staff),
the report may be editable through the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Compliance Report
Detail</font> page.
The only reports that an internal user can view are those that are
submitted from an external user, or those that were submitted in hard
copy form and are entered electronically by DO/LAA staff.Once the
entire report has been validated and submitted, only portions of the
report will be editable as part of the review process performed by
DO/LAA staff.</p>

<p>This Help page will focus on
the fields you view on the
<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Compliance Report
Detail</font> page, fields that
are editable IF you are
entering a hard copy report, or fields you will edit during the review
process. Certain steps may need to be completed in other sections of
the system in order to access a report through the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Compliance
Report
Detail</font> page for continued
editing. These steps are discussed briefly
under the heading &#8220;How Are Compliance Reports
Electronically Entered by
the DO/LAA?&#8221; below. The end of this Help page provides links to several
&#8220;Related Help Topics&#8221; that will allow direct access to additional Help
you may need during this process.</p>

<h2><a name="howEntered"></a><br>How Are Compliance Reports Electronically Entered by the
DO/LAA?</h2>

<p>Recall, DO/LAA staff will enter hard copy reports submitted by
the
owner or operator of a facility. In order to begin report entry the
following steps are necessary:</p>

<ul>

  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility
Profile</font>: confirm existence or create<br>

    <br>

Under the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facilities</font>
tab perform a <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility
Search</font> using the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility
ID</font>. If you are unable to locate the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility ID</font>
in the system, it is
likely the facility has not yet been created within the system and a
report cannot be entered until this is done. You must create the
facility using the second-level menu <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Create Facility</font>
of the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facilities</font>
tab. This is the first step of creating a <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility Detail</font>.
Please
refer to the Help page for <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Create Facility</font>
for further important
information concerning creating a facility.<br>

    <br>

  </li>

  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility
Profile</font>&nbsp;<img alt="Small Green Arrow" src="images/grn_rt_arrow_small.gif" height="9" width="20">
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Compliance
Report(s)</font>: begin report entry<br>

    <br>

Once you have created, if necessary, and accessed the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility Detail</font>
page of the requesting facility, select the third-level menu <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Compliance
Report(s)</font> link. The initiation of report entry occurs in
this section
of the system. The instant you generate a report through this link the
system generates a <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Compliance
Report Detail</font> page. For Help on beginning
the report entry, please refer to the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Compliance Report(s)</font>
Help page for
more information.</li>

</ul>

<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
</p>

<h2><a name="locate_view"></a><br>Locating and Viewing an Electronic Compliance Report</h2>

<p>You can
locate a report and access a <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Compliance Report
Detail</font> page throughout
many of the system pages, most usually through the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Compliance Report
Search</font> or a <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility Detail</font>
pages.</p>

<ul>

  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility
Profile</font>&nbsp;<img alt="Small Green Arrow" src="images/grn_rt_arrow_small.gif" height="9" width="20">
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Compliance
Report(s) </font>third-level menu will display a datagrid of all
reports for the specific facility.<br>

    <br>

  </li>

  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Compliance
Report Search</font> allows
you to search for available reports using many different search
criteria. This feature is available on the opening page for the
first-level menu called <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Compliance
Reports</font>. For Help on this feature,
refer to the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Compliance
Report Search</font> Help page. Reports that fit the
search criteria you have set will show up in the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Search Results</font>
datagrid after you have performed a <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Compliance Report
Search</font>.</li>

</ul>

<p>Using either method, the datagrid will contain a column with
the <font color="#996633"><u><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Report
ID</font></u></font> which is hyperlinked to the
specific <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Compliance
Report Detail</font> page.

when reviewing a report, you can stop at any point and save your work
by clicking&nbsp;<img alt="Save Button" src="images/btn_save.jpg" height="20" width="47">
at the bottom of the page or cancel your work by clicking <img alt="Cancel Button" src="images/btn_capCancel.jpg" height="20" width="56">.
Clicking&nbsp;<img alt="Cancel Button" src="images/btn_capCancel.jpg" height="20" width="56">

This button is used to &#8220;reset&#8221; the data fields that have been changed
since the last save. Notes and attachments entered into the system are
not affected by clicking <img alt="Cancel Button" src="images/btn_capCancel.jpg" height="20" width="56">.
These documents are permanent unless deleted
before submission to the system.</p>

<p><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit

Reports</font>
may be deleted by clicking the&nbsp;<img alt="Delete Button" src="images/btn_delete.jpg" height="20" width="57">
button at the bottom of the page while
in edit mode. This option is ONLY available while the report is in
<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Draft</font>
form (has not yet been submitted). Deleting will remove the
report and all attachments from the system.</p>

<h2><a name="valid_submit"></a><br>Validation and Submitting &#8211;&nbsp;
<img alt="Validate Button" src="images/btn_validate.jpg" height="20" width="66"> 
and&nbsp;<img alt="Submit Button" src="images/btn_submit.jpg" height="21" width="59"> </h2>

<p>Recall, only <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit
Evaluation
Reports</font> and <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Other Compliance
Reports</font> may be entered electronically, and
submitted, by DO/LAA staff when a hard copy form is received from the
facility. When you are ready to submit the completed report, it will
need to pass a validation process to ensure the minimum information is
included. These validation checks apply equally to internal and
external submittals. Therefore, if you are entering a hard copy report
it is important that all information contained in the report is entered
before submission. To <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Validate</font>
click&nbsp;<img alt="Validate Button" src="images/btn_validate.jpg" height="20" width="66">
at the bottom of the page. A
pop-up box will appear displaying any issues associated with the
validation. The issue(s) must be resolved in order for report submittal
to occur.</p>

<p>Issues with validation are categorized as either ERRORs,
WARNINGs or INFOs. ERRORs must be resolved before the document can be
validated. If you only experience WARNINGs or INFOs, the validation
process will be successful without the need to click validate again;
however, WARNINGs and INFOs may be viewed and corrected/changed before
submission. If changes are made after validation, it will be necessary
to validate again.</p>

<p>To navigate to any ERRORs, WARNINGs or INFOs, click on the
<font color="#996633"><u>brown
underlined</u></font> hyperlink associated with the issue.
This will take you to
the page where it was detected. The page should open in the edit mode.
If it is an error, you will need to correct the error and navigate back
to the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Application
Detail</font> page to validate again or open the validation
pop-up using the toolbar at the bottom of your computer screen and move
on to the next error message hyperlink until all errors have been
corrected. WARNINGs and INFOs may be viewed by following the above
procedure. When viewing, you can determine if the information requires
a change or if you want to keep the information as originally
determined. WARNINGs typically may be more significant issues than
ERRORs.</p>

<p>Once the document passes validation, you will see the
Information-
validation successful message at the top of the screen. Once all issues
are resolved, click&nbsp;<img alt="Submit Button" src="images/btn_submit.jpg" height="21" width="59">
to complete the process.</p>

  <h3>TV Annual Compliance Certification</h3>

  <p>This section explains the
fields you will see in a <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">TV Annual Compliance
Certification</font> and fields
that are completed as part of the process of reviewing a report. Please
note, Title V facilities will be required to submit their 
<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">TV Annual
Compliance Certification</font> electronically in the system;
therefore, you
will not be able to create a <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">TV Annual Compliance
Certification</font>. Title
V facilities have two options available for fulfilling the electronic
submittal requirement. They may choose to complete the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Identification
of Intermittent Compliance (IC)</font> (including any necessary
attachments)
and <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Any
Material Information Not Established Through the Applicable
Permit Terms and Conditions That May Indicate Non-Compliance</font>
sections
or they may choose to use their own form that fulfills the requirements
for a <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">TV
Annual Compliance Certification</font> and attach the document in
the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Attachments</font>
section of the system&#8217;s form.</p>

  <h3>Other Compliance Reports</h3>

  <p>This section explains the fields you will see in an <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Other Compliance
Report</font>, fields to complete when you are entering a hard
copy report
received, and fields that are completed as part of the process of
reviewing a report.</p>

  <ul>

    <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">AQD
Staff</font> Section
      <ul>

        <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Received
On</font>: This field identifies the date the
report was electronically submitted by an external user, or if entry is
occurring by DO/LAA staff, enter the received by Ohio EPA date (e.g.,
post mark date).<br>

          <br>

        </li>

        <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Reviewed
On</font> (only viewable after submission): Enter
the date you performed a review of the contents of the report.<br>

          <br>

        </li>

        <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Reviewed
By</font> (only viewable after submission): This field will
default
to the name of the person performing the review when the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Reviewed On</font>
date is entered. It is not editable; therefore, if you are not
reviewing a report you should not enter a <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Reviewed On</font>
date.<br>

          <br>

        </li>

        <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Report
Accepted</font>: This field will default to <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Not Yet Reviewed</font>.
When reviewing
it must be changed to <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Yes,
No,</font> or <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">No-Revision
Requested</font>. If entry is
occurring by DO/LAA staff you will only be able to edit this field
after electronic submission occurs. Keep in mind, selecting an
acceptance type does not generate a workflow or directly notify a
facility. For example, if <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">No-Revision Requested
          </font>is selected, DO/LAA
staff will need to take appropriate action outside of the system to
request the revision.<br>

          <br>

        </li>

        <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Deviations
Reported</font>: Upon submittal this field will be blank. When

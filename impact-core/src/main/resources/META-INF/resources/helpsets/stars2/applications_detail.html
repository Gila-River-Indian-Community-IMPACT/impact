<h1>Application Detail</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>In this system, the term &#8220;application&#8221; is used to identify
several
types of document submittals, including permit applications,
permit-by-rule (PBR) notifications, request administrative permit
modifications (RAPM), permit revocation requests and extension
requests.</p>

<p>Applications are either completed by an applicant manually
(hard copy) or electronically. Hard copy submittals are entered
electronically by DO/LAA staff. The same application forms are
completed regardless of whether they are entered by DO/LAA staff from
hard copy applications or submitted electronically through the gateway
by a regulated community user. All Title V and PTI/PTIO applications are required to be submitted electronically by <u>ANY Title V or &#8220;synthetic minor&#8221; source</u>.
However, the ability for DO/LAA staff to enter a hard copy PTI/PTIO
application for all types of sources is retained in the system. &#8220;True
minor&#8221; sources will retain the option to submit hard copy PTI/PTIO
applications. Accepting a hard copy PTI/PTIO application from a Title V
or &#8220;synthetic minor&#8221; source would only occur under rare circumstances,
for example if an applicant is in hardship, as decided on a
case-by-case basis. There is the exception that Title V
applications are required to be submitted electronically and so cannot
be completed in hard copy form and entered electronically by DO/LAA
staff. </p>

<p>The <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Application
Detail</font> page is the electronic depiction of all
of the application information that can be found in the hard copy form
except basic facility information which is contained in the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility
Profile</font>. Depending on whether you are viewing an
application that has
been submitted or you are viewing an application that has yet to be
submitted (i.e., an application in the process of being electronically
entered by DO/LAA staff), the application may be editable through this
page. The only applications that an internal user can view are those
that are submitted from an external user, or those that were submitted
in hard copy form and are entered electronically by DO/LAA staff. Once
the entire application has been validated and submitted, the
application will not be editable, nor will you be able to delete it.</p>

<p><font color="#996633">This Help page will focus

</font><font color="#996633" face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Application
Detail</font><font color="#996633"> page and fields

<h2>How are Applications Electronically Entered by the
DO/LAA?</h2>

<p>Recall, DO/LAA staff will enter hard copy applications, except
Title V
applications will never be entered by the DO/LAA. In order to begin application entry the following steps are
necessary:</p>

<ul>

  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility
Profile</font>: confirm existence or create.<br>

    <br>

Under the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facilities</font>
tab perform a <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility
Search</font> using the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility
ID</font>. If you are unable to locate the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility ID</font>
in the system, it is
likely the facility has not yet been created within the system and an
application cannot be entered until this is done. You must create the
facility using the second-level menu <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Create Facility</font>
of the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facilities</font>
tab. This is the first step of creating a <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility Detail</font>.
Please
refer to the Help page for <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Create Facility</font>
for further important
information concerning creating a facility.<br>

    <br>

Note that before entering an application, all emissions unit,
processes, control equipment and egress points must be created. This is
also accomplished through the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility Detail</font>
and its third-level
menu. Please refer to the Help page for <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility Detail</font>
and Facility
Tree for further important information concerning these steps.<br>

    <br>

  </li>

  <li> <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility
Profile -&gt; Application(s):</font>
begin application entry<br>

    <br>

Once you have
created, if necessary, and accessed the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility Detail</font>
page of the requesting facility, select the third-level menu <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Application(s)</font>
link. The initiation of application entry occurs in this
section of the system. The instant you generate an application through
this link the system generates an <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Application Detail </font>page.
For Help on
beginning the application entry, please refer to the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Application(s) </font>Help
page for more information. </li>

</ul>

<h2>Saving or Canceling - <img style="width: 47px; height: 20px;" title="Save Button" src="images/btn_save.jpg" alt="Save Button"> and <img style="width: 56px; height: 20px;" title="Cancel Button" src="images/btn_capCancel.jpg" alt="Cancel Button"></h2>

<p>When entering an application, you can
stop at any point and save your work by clicking <img style="width: 47px; height: 20px;" title="Save Button" src="images/btn_save.jpg" alt="Save Button"> at the
bottom of the
page or cancel your work by clicking <img style="width: 56px; height: 20px;" title="Cancel Button" src="images/btn_capCancel.jpg" alt="Cancel Button">.
Clicking <img style="width: 56px; height: 20px;" title="Cancel Button" src="images/btn_capCancel.jpg" alt="Cancel Button"> will erase any
application information you just entered electronically. This button is
used to &#8220;reset&#8221; the data fields that have been changed since the last
save.</p>

<p>Notes and attachments entered into the system are not affected
by
clicking <img style="width: 56px; height: 20px;" title="Cancel Button" src="images/btn_capCancel.jpg" alt="Cancel Button">. These documents are permanent unless
deleted before
submission to the system.
If the application is saved but not submitted it will remain editable.
After the application has been submitted, the fields are locked and
cannot be edited except by users with Administrative privileges.</p>

<h2>Editing &#8211; <img style="width: 40px; height: 20px;" title="Edit Button" src="images/btn_edit.jpg" alt="Edit Button">
</h2>

<p>Applications being entered by DO/LAA staff that have been
saved but not submitted can continue to be edited by clicking <img style="width: 40px; height: 20px;" title="Edit Button" src="images/btn_edit.jpg" alt="Edit Button"> at the
bottom of the page. Enter information as needed and <img style="width: 47px; height: 20px;" title="Save Button" src="images/btn_save.jpg" alt="Save Button"> or <img style="width: 56px; height: 20px;" title="Cancel Button" src="images/btn_capCancel.jpg" alt="Cancel Button">. </p>

<h2>Validation
and Submitting &#8211; <img style="width: 66px; height: 20px;" title="Validate Button" src="images/btn_validate.jpg" alt="Validate Button"> and <img style="width: 57px; height: 20px;" title="Submit Button" src="images/btn_submit.jpg" alt="Submit Button">
</h2>

<p>When you are ready to submit the completed
application, it will need to pass a validation process to ensure the
minimum information is included. These validation checks apply equally
to internal and external submittals. Therefore, if you are entering a
hard copy application it is important that all information contained in
the application is entered before submission. To <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Validate</font>
click <img style="width: 66px; height: 20px;" title="Validate Button" src="images/btn_validate.jpg" alt="Validate Button"> at the
bottom of the page. A pop-up box will appear displaying any issues
associated with the validation. The issue(s) must be resolved in order
for application submittal to occur.</p>

<p>Issues with validation are categorized as either ERRORs,
WARNINGs or
INFOs. ERRORs must be resolved before the document can be validated. If
you only experience WARNINGs or INFOs, the validation process will be
successful without the need to click validate again; however, WARNINGs
and INFOs may be viewed and corrected/changed before submission. If
changes are made after validation, it will be necessary to validate
again.</p>

<p>To navigate to any ERRORs, WARNINGs or INFOs, click on the <font color="#996633"><u>brown
underlined</u></font> hyperlink associated with the issue.
This will take you to
the page where it was detected. The page should open in the edit mode.
If it is an error, you will need to correct the error and navigate back
to the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Application
Detail</font> page to validate again or open the validation
pop-up using the toolbar at the bottom of your computer screen and move
on to the next error message hyperlink until all errors have been
corrected. WARNINGs and INFOs may be viewed by following the above
procedure. When viewing, you can determine if the information requires
a change or if you want to keep the information as originally
determined. WARNINGs typically may be more significant issues than
ERRORs.</p>

<p>Once the document passes validation, you will see the
following
validation successful message and a green checkmark at the top of the
Application Tree.</p>

<div align="center">
<p><img alt="Application Successful" src="images/validation_successful.jpg" title="Validation Successful" style="border: 1px solid ; width: 556px; height: 160px;" vspace="4"></p>

</div>

<p>Once all issues are resolved, click <img style="width: 57px; height: 20px;" title="Submit Button" src="images/btn_submit.jpg" alt="Submit Button"> to
complete the process.</p>

<h2>Locating and Viewing an Electronic
Application</h2>

<p>You can locate an application and access an <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Application
Detail</font> page throughout many of the system pages, most
usually through
the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Application
Search</font> or <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility
Profile</font> pages.</p>

<ul>

  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility
Profile -&gt; Application(s)</font> third-level menu will
display a datagrid of all
applications for the specific facility.<br>

    <br>

  </li>

  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Application
Search</font> allows you
to search for available applications using many different search
criteria. This feature is available on the opening page for the
first-level menu called <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Applications</font>.
For Help on this feature, refer
to the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Applications
Search</font> Help page. Applications that fit the search
criteria you have set will show up in the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Request List</font>
datagrid after
you have performed an <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Applications
Search</font>.<br>

    <br>

  </li>

</ul>

<p>Using either method, the datagrid will contain a column with
the
<font color="#996633" face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><u>Request
number</u></font> which is hyperlinked to the specific <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Application Detail</font>
page. Click on the <font color="#996633" face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><u>Request
number</u></font>.</p>

The datagrid will also contain a column named <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Submitted</font>
identifying
either <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">YES</font>
or <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">NO</font>.
<ul>

  <li>Electronically Submitted<br>

If you view an application that has been submitted (<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Yes</font>), it
will no
longer be editable. This feature is used to review the application and
begin preparing any necessary permit document.<br>

    <br>

  </li>

  <li>Applications Not Yet Submitted Electronically<br>

Applications being entered by DO/LAA staff that have not yet been
submitted (<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">No</font>)
remain editable. Applications being entered by external
users who have not yet submitted the application will not be viewable
until submission occurs.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Application Detail Data Fields</h2>

<p>The information you see on the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Application Detail</font>
page may depend on
the type of application you are viewing, or editing. The information
below is relevant to each request type available.</p>

<p><a href="#main_menu">Back to Main Menu</a>
<a name="ptiptio_app_detail"></a></p>

<h3>PTI/PTIO Application Detail</h3>

<ul>

  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Date
application received</font><br>

The date the signed hard copy application
was actually stamped into the DO/LAA or the date the electronic version
was submitted by an external user. This date will be the basis for
tracking all permit processing statistics.<br>

    <br>

  </li>

  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Is
this a legacy State PTO Application</font><br>

This is a legacy application
if it was received prior to the June 13, 2008 shut down of the old
STARS and PTIs 2000 systems. An application submitted after this date
is expected to comply with the validation requirements of system.<br>

    <br>

  </li>

  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">For

level using the Application Tree. This is discussed below.<br>

    <br>

  </li>

  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Purpose
of Application</font><br>

This should contain an explanation of why the permit is being sought.
This text will be used in the public notice for any permit issued for
this application and; therefore, it may be edited for purposes of

    </ul>

  </li>

  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">PER
Due Date</font><br>
Each non-Title V facility that will be issued a PTIO
(including FEPTIO) will be able to choose from four days which day of
the year they will submit their annual PER (Permit Evaluation Report).
This selection is made in the first application because all
subsequent PTIOs issued for the facility will be given the same due
date. If a due date has not previously been established you may edit
this field by selecting from the picklist the due date the applicant
requested in their hardcopy application. &nbsp;After the first time it
is selected, the same due date should be entered in subsequent
applications. &nbsp;After a due date has been established in a PTIO,
the due date cannot be changed except by established procedures and by
a system administrator. &nbsp;If you have a facility requesting a
change to a due date contact Central Office.<br>

<h3>Title V Permit Application Detail</h3>

<p>Recall, Title V applications are required to be submitted
by the
applicant electronically; therefore, edit mode or changes by DO/LAA
staff are not possible. The application had to pass a validation check
to be submitted to Ohio EPA for you to view. The following describes
the fields that will be viewable during your application review.</p>

<ul>

  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Reason
for application</font><br>

Identifies the reason for the application. <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Initial</font>
is selected when a
Title V Permit has not been issued for the facility before. If <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Revision/Modification/Reopening</font>
is identified it will also identify the
type: <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Reopening,
Rescind/Reissue</font>, <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">SPM</font>
(significant permit modification), <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">MPM</font>
(minor permit modification), <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">APA</font>
(administratiave permit
amendment), or <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Off
permit change</font>.<br>

    <br>

  </li>

  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Summary</font><br>

Identifies the explanation of why the permit is being sought. This text
will be used in the public notice for this permit.<br>

    <br>

  </li>

  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Statutory
Agent</font><br>

Identifies the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Statutory
Agent</font> as registered with the Secretary of
State. A <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Statutory
Agent</font> is the person or corporation officially
designated by a corporation to receive service of process and other
official documents for the corporation. Every corporation is required
to name a <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Statutory
Agent</font> when they incorporate in Ohio. It is possible
that if a Title V source owner or operator is not a corporation, they
will not have a <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Statutory
Agent</font>. In such cases of a sole proprietor or
partnership, the individuals are the agent.<br>

    <br>

  </li>

  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Potential
to Emit (PTE)</font><br>

The table identifies information pertaining to criteria pollutants and
hazardous air pollutants (HAPs).
    <ul>

      <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Criteria
Pollutants</font>:<br>

The <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">EU Total</font>
(PTE) column is automatically calculated by the system
based on PTE values entered by the applicant for each emissions unit
under the specific <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Emissions
Unit</font> pages. This step is discussed under
the Application Tree section of this Help page below. The final column
will automatically indicate whether the facility is <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Major</font> or
        <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Non-Major</font>.&nbsp;
        <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Not
Applicable</font> in this column indicates there is no PTE
entered for
that pollutant.<br>

        <br>

The <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility
PTE</font> value may be entered for each
pollutant that has an <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">EU
Total </font>(PTE). This should be done when the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility
PTE</font> value does not equal the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">EU Total</font>
(PTE). For example, if
multiple emissions units share a PTE value, the PTE value would be
identified for each individual emissions unit on the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Emissions Unit</font>
pages and would be summed together in the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">EU Total</font>
(PTE) column. This
would be adjusted down to the actual <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility PTE</font>
value and entered in
that appropriate column.<br>

        <br>

With regards to particulate matter, the table contains the following
pollutant types:<br>

        <br>

        <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">PM10
(Filt)</font> - Primary PM10, Filterable Portion Only<br>

        <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">PM10</font>
- Primary PM10 (Includes Filterables + condensibles)(PM&lt;10
Microns)<br>

        <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">PM2.5
(Filt)</font> - Primary PM2.5, Filterable Portion Only<br>

        <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">PM2.5</font>
- Primary PM2.55 (Includes Filterables + Condensibles)(PM,2.5
Microns)<br>

        <br>

Currently, the particulate matter criteria pollutant threshold is based
on both PM10 and PM2.5 since both pollutants are subject to the
National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). In addition, the NAAQS
inherently captures condensible particulate matter in addition to the
stack-filterable particulate matter. Accordingly, this Title V
application recognizes both filterable and condensible particulate
matter. IMPACT, at the emissions unit level, automatically
calculates the condensible fraction for any source category recognized
by USEPA that produces condensible particulate matter emissions (i.e.,
there is a federal emission factor for the SCC category). You can add a
source-specific calculated value if your source has been tested. Ohio
EPA recognizes the variability in these factors, and also recognizes
that a straight calculation of the condensible PM, NOx, and SO2
emissions can results in double counting. The <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility PTE</font>
can be used
to adjust the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">EU
Total PTE</font> value downward in the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility PTE</font>
column. <br>

        <br>

      </li>

      <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Hazardous
Air Pollutants (HAPs)</font><br>

This section is automatically calculated based on information entered
by the applicant for each emissions unit under the specific <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Emissions
Unit</font> pages. This step is discussed under the Application
Tree section of this Help page below.<br>

        <br>

buttons.</li></ul><ul><li><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">Air Contaminant Sources in this Application</span><br>This section will contain a datagrid that identifies summary
information of the emissions units that have been included in the
application. &nbsp;Specific information about the emissions units is found
by naviagating through the tree.</li></ul><ul><li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility-Wide

For each <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">PTE(ton/year)</font>
a <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">PTE
Determination Basis</font> was entered. If this was identified as
a trade
secret the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Reason
Determination Basis is a Trade Secret</font> column
will contain a hyperlink where you can view the reason. Insignificant
emissions units will also have a column identifying the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Rule Based

        <br>

      </li>

      <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Hazardous
Air Pollutants (HAPs)</font><br>

The datagrid at the bottom of the table identifies HAPs applicable to
the emissions unit. If the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">PTE Determination
Basis</font> was identified as a
trade secret a justification for the trade secret will be identified
and viewable through the hyperlink. Insignificant emissions units will
also have a column identifying the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Rule Based Applicable
Requirements</font>.<br>

        <br>

The <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">HAP-Single
Hazardous Air Pollutants</font> and <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">HAPs-Total Combined

only)<br>

If there are any limitations on the operations of the specific
emissions unit that affect any of the PTE values listed on this page, <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Yes</font>
would have been selected and a textbox will identify the
limitations.<br>

        <br>

      </li>

      <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Compliance
Monitoring Equipment/Enhanced

If the facility is required by Section 114(a)(3) to have certain
monitoring activities, the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Yes</font>
radio button should have been selected.
If <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Yes</font>
was selected, a textbox will identify the monitoring. It will
also identify whether or not the emissions unit will comply with the
requirements on a timely basis.<br>

        <br>

      </li>

      <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Emissions
Unit-Specific
Requirements</font> (Non-insignificant emissions units only)<br>

The datagrids at the bottom of the page will identify <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">State and
Federally Enforceable Requirements</font> and <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">State Only
Enforceable

for Help on these fields.<br>

        <br>

      </li>

      <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Attachments</font><br>

This section is where emissions
unit specific documents are attached to the application (e.g., EAC
forms, process flow diagrams, modeling). The document will be
identified, and viewable, in a datagrid. The column marked <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Description</font>
contains text entered by the applicant as a description of the
document. If the applicant identified the document contains a trade
secret, they were required to upload both a &#8220;public&#8221; and &#8220;secret&#8221; file.
These will be available for viewing by clicking on the&nbsp;<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Attachment Type</font>
hyperlink under the respective columns (please not that only those with
specific rights in the system will be able to view, and download from,
the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Trade
Secret Document</font> download column). Trade secret submissions
also require a <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Trade
Secret Justification</font> (also viewable by clicking on
the hyperlinked text).<br>

        <br>

      </li>

      <li>If the Application Tree contains an emissions
unit with one or more alternative operating scenarios
(non-insignificant emissions units only) it will be identified by:
        <div align="center">
        <p><img alt="Example of Alternate Scenario" src="images/app_tree_alt_scenario.jpg" title="Example of Alternate Scenario" style="border: 1px solid ; width: 169px; height: 59px;" vspace="4"></p>

        </div>

When you click on this you will go to the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Alternate or Multiple
Operating
Scenarios</font> page where you will see information relevant to
the
alternative operating scenario. This information will be very similar
to that found on the specific <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Emissions Unit</font>
page already described
above; however, it is relevant to the alternative operating scenario
that is being proposed.<br>

        <br>

      </li>

      <li>If the Application Tree contains a grouping
of emissions units it will be identified by:
        <div align="center">
        <p><img alt="Example of Emissions unit Grouping" src="images/app_tree_euGroup.jpg" title="Example of Emissions Unit Grouping" style="border: 1px solid ; width: 131px; height: 28px;" vspace="4"></p>

        </div>

A grouping may have been
identified, for example, if the facility has multiple emissions units
under a single allowable emissions limit. Clicking on this will take
you to the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Emissions
Unit Group</font> page where you can see the emissions
units in that group. You will see information relevant to the group
emissions unit(s) applicable requirements. This information will be
very similar to that found on the specific <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Emissions Unit</font>
page already
described above; however, it is relevant to the grouping only.<br>

<h3>Permit by Rule Notification Detail</h3>

<p>This notification is used to install, if applicable, and/or
operate an emissions unit(s) under a permit-by-rule (PBR) rather than a
traditional permit. If a facility requests to install and/or operate
under a PBR they must submit a complete PBR Notification. This includes
completing the information on the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Application Detail</font>
screen and
completing a <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Permit
by Rule Notification Supplement Form</font> for the
specific PBR and attaching this to the notification. If DO/LAA staff
are entering a hard copy notification, the same steps should be
completed. In order for an emissions unit to be covered under a PBR, it
cannot be covered under any other type of permit, except a Title V Permit.
Therefore, it may be necessary to process a revocation of a previously
issued permit in order to operate under the PBR. Refer to the &#8220;Request
Permit Rescission&#8221; heading below for performing this step. The
following fields are viewable, and editable when entering an
application:</p>

<ul>

  <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Date
Request Received</font>: if you are entering this request
electronically, enter the date as postmarked on the notification
submitted by the facility.<br>

    <br>

  </li>

  <li>Select the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">PBR
Reason</font> from the picklist and click <img style="width: 47px; height: 20px;" title="Save Button" src="images/btn_save.jpg" alt="Save Button">.<br>

    <br>

  </li>

  <li>Select the emissions unit(s) that will be associated with
the
notification. In order to associate an emissions unit with an
application you must first have created the emissions unit in the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility
Profile</font>. If you need Help with this process refer to the
Help
pages for Facility Tree and <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Facility Detail</font>.
You can associate an
emissions unit either by clicking on the <img style="width: 76px; height: 20px;" title="Select EUs Button" src="images/btn_selectEUs.jpg" alt="Select EUs Button">
or by selecting the EU ID on
the Application Tree to the left of the screen. Both of these features
are discussed under the &#8220;PTI/PTIO Application Detail&#8221; heading of this
Help page.<br>

    <br>

  </li>

  <li>After associating the emissions unit(s), when you view the
specific <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Emissions
Units</font> page by clicking on the EU ID in the
Application Tree you will see a table of any active permits currently
applicable to the emissions unit. It will be necessary to revoke, or
partially revoke (only the portion of the permit the emissions unit is
subject to) these permit(s) (except a Title V Permit). Refer to the
&#8220;Request Permit Rescission&#8221; heading below for performing this step.<br>

    <br>
